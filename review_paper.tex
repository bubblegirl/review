\section{Introduction}
% HABs, testing shit
Harmful algal bloom-forming dinoflagellates have become an increasingly observed phenomena on the global scale. They cause oxygen depletion which limits its availability to other organisms, block sunlight for the benthos and potentially produce harmful compounds \cite{grandjean2008centers}, an example for the latter is \emph{Gambierdiscus spp.} \cite{lehane2000ciguatera}. This genus is especially prevalent in the literature as they produce toxins responsible for ciguatera fish	poisoning (CFP)	in humans through bioaccumulation in tropical and sub-tropical fish. It is classically reported in regions bordering on the Pacific and Indian ocean, however in the last decade \emph{G. toxicus} has been found as far into the northern hemisphere as the Mediterranean Sea. This expansion of habitat may be due t global warming \cite{aligizaki2008morphological}. \
A study correlating CFP related calls from the US national poison centre data with storms and sea surface temperature, this showed that sea surface temperature was a relevant factor for CFP incidence and extrapolate that climate change related sea temperature rise could escalate CFP by 200 - 400 \% in the US alone \cite{garces2012habitat}

% history, species confusion, differenc ein toxicity within same species
Vast diversity of phytoplankton recently discovered at varying taxonomic levels \cite{simon2009diversity}. 
New molecular methods promise many more species to be documented \cite{murray2012genetic,murray2012transcriptomics}.
Currently only 160 described benthic dinoflagellates \cite{taylor2008dinoflagellate} %check plus explain benthic
Benthic dinoflagellate implicated in CFP in 1977 sparked interest in this phylum \cite{yasumoto1977finding}.
Genus \emph{Gambierdiscus} named after location first sampled, Gmabier Islands in French Polynesia, long believed to be monophyletic with \emph{Gambierdiscus toxicus} \cite{adachi1979thecal} %when were more species discovered?
\emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. produce ciguatoxins (CTX) and maitotoxins (MTX) \cite{chinain1997intraspecific,chinain1999morphology,chinain1999seasonal,chinain2010growth,holmes1998gambierdiscus,rhodes2010toxic,fraga2011gambierdiscus,holland2013differences}

Increase in HAB events reported globally \cite{hallegraeff2010ocean} % HAB impact on enviro and humans: \cite{garces2012habitat}
CFP increase of 60\% in last decade in Pacific Islands \cite{skinner2011ciguatera}
New \emph{Gambierdiscus} species discovered, evidence that they may all have individual toxin profiles \cite{chinain2010growth,fraga2011gambierdiscus,holland2013differences}
In other dinoflagellates, toxin producton varies at species level and within species.
HAB species are monitored for early detection of CFP outbreak.
Climate change is impacting the marine environment - a model ocean for changing conditions is the Mediterranean Sea \cite{lejeusne2010climate}, where \emph{Gambierdiscus} has extended it's habitat to since the early 2000s \cite{aligizaki2008morphological}.

\section{Toxins produced by \emph{Gambierdiscus}}
%table 1.3 - amend with new info
% toxin mod in the food chain - or seperate section?
%\emph{G. toxicus} has been shown to produce a range of toxins other than ciguatoxins \cite{holmes1994purification,murata1993structure} Furthermore, other species within this genus produce ciguatoxin like substances, such as \emph{G. polynesiensis}, \emph{G. australes} and \emph{G. pacificus} \cite{roeder2010characteristic}. 

%trediculous symptomology detailed in sims1987theoretical

Ciguateric seafood is characteristically impossible to discern during culinary preparation as it does not exhibit any obviously recognisable differences to non toxic specimens and is heat resistant \cite{withers1982ciguatera}. Hence toxin presence is usually only diagnosed retrospectively from CFP symptoms in conjunction with recent seafood consumption \cite{sims1987theoretical} as samples of the food consumed are rarely obtained. Due to diagnosis depending on the deductive capability of the medical professional, CFP is predicted to be widely under reported with as little of 20 \% of cases being reported  in Queensland, Australia, alone \cite{lewis2006ciguatera}. The disease can manifest as over 180 symptoms, with varying levels of severity, and differ even between individuals at the same time and source of exposure \cite{sims1987theoretical}. The effects of the disease appear to be cumulative as severity increases with previous exposure \cite{emerson1983preliminary}. Commonly a couple hours after consumption, the initial symptoms are gastrointestinal which can be followed by cardiovascular and neurological manifestations \cite{sims1987theoretical}. They can persist between weeks to years, and recurrence is a common phenomenon induced by a variety of factors such as alcohol, fish or meat consumption \cite{lewis2006ciguatera} as well as sexual activity \cite{lange1992travel}. \\
Symptoms of CFP can vary between geographical locations \cite{molgo2000ciguatera,dickey2010ciguatera}, which likely contributes to the inefficiency of diagnosis. This could be de to the structural difference between CTXs, indeed and or MTXs. Hence accurate determination of CTX and MTX congeners is vital to understanding toxicology, for linked risks and symptoms symptoms of CFP - which is an avenue of investigation that urgently needs attention.\\

In 1979 the great breakthrough in understanding CFP was that an algal species, \emph{G. toxicus}, produces the toxins that cause the disease and that the toxins bioaccumulate up the food chain \citep{adachi1979thecal}. With the advent of further species discovery from 1995 onwards \cite{faust1995observation}, the inconsistency in toxin measurements between isolates tested started to make sense - they are different species. The current challenge is to characterise the species specific toxin profiles, employing a consistent and conclusive methodology. Bioassays provide an excellent indicator to a species' toxicity, however it does not suffice to elucidate a detailed toxin profile - liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis is required. \emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. produce more than just CTXs - notably MTXs are also commonly registered \cite{holmes1994purification,murata1993structure}. It has, until recently, been assumed in the literature that CTXs are the sole culprit in CFP as MTXs are water soluble. CTXs have been isolated form the Pacific, Caribbean and the Indian ocean. The  structure varies between the Pacific and the Caribbean congeners, with the structures of the Indian ocean analogues still to be determined. Symptomatology of CFP varies between the three regions, however if the variance is dependent on  the structural difference, or for example due to different precursor modification during biomagnification, is yet to be determined \cite{lewis2006ciguatera}. Understanding the molecular evolution and ecology of the toxins, coupled with which species produce them and under what circumstances, are points that are essential to dealing with harmful algal blooms and their impact on humans and the environment. Whether and which changing environmental cues play a role is imperative for predictive purposes with the advent of global warming \cite{llewellyn2010revisiting}.  \\

\subsection{CTX}
Toxins in the CTX family consist of lipid soluble polyether ladders which act as sodium channel activators \cite{dechraoui1999ciguatoxins}. They are orally effective in humans at the pM and mM concentration range \cite{molgo2000ciguatera}, causing an influx of Na$^{+}$ ions and hence spontaneous action potentials in the cell, especially active on voltage sensitive channels along the nodes of Ranvier \cite{sims1987theoretical,mattei1999neurotoxins,lewis1992action,molgo2000ciguatera}. \\	   
Currently CTXs are prefixed by their origin, where members from the Pacific, Caribbean and Indian ocean are designated P-CTX, C-CTX and I-CTX respectively. % don't know C-PTX subdivision ref... for P-CTX it's \cite{} I-CYX is\cite}
The congeners are further subdivided on a structural basis into type I and type II within P-CTXs, followed by all C-CTXs as type III - the molecular structure of I-CTXs have not been elucidated to such an extent as to assign a type \cite{legrand1997two,hamilton2002multiple,hamilton2002isolation}, An overview of the designations can be found in table x.  \\
Type I P-CTXs consist of 13 rings with 60 C atoms \cite{murata1990structures,lewis1991purification,lewis1993origin}, including the first completely defined CTX which was isolated from moray eels and designated P-CTX-1B \cite{murata1990structures} or also described as CTX-1 \cite{lewis1991purification}. P-CTX-2 and P-CTX-3 were isolated from the same extracts but exhibited an alternate structure and toxicity in mice \cite{lewis1991purification}. It has been suggested by two research groups that P-CTX-1, P-CTX-2 and P-CTX-3 may be derivatives from the dinoflagellate precursors CTX-4A and CTX-4B (also GTX-4B by Murata et al \cite{murata1990structures}) \cite{lewis1993origin,yasumoto2000structural}. So far, P-CTX-4A and P-CTX-4B have been isolated from \emph{Gambierdiscus polynesiensis} culture extracts \cite{chinain2010growth}, while P-CTX-1, P-CTX-2 and P-CTX-3 have not. \\
The structure for type II P-CTX-3C consists of 13 ring and 57 C atoms and has been isolated first from \emph{Gambierdiscus} culture \cite{satake1993structure}, then from \emph{G. polynesiensis} \cite{chinain2010growth}. There are two known congeners of P-CTX-3C which have been isolated - 49-epi-CTX-3C (or CTX-3B by Chinain et al \cite{chinain2010growth}) and M-seco-CTX-3C from \emph{Gambierdiscus} \cite{satake1993structure} and \emph{G. polynesiensis} \cite{chinain2010growth}. Two type II CTXs have been isolated from Moray eel, 2,3-dihydroxy-CTX-3C (or CTX-2A1) and 51-hydroxy-CTX-3C \cite{satake1998isolation}, and are suspected to constitute oxygenated metabolites of P-CTX-3. \\ %\cite{yasumoto2000structural} check ref as well as if P-CTX3 or P-CTX-3C 
Structurally C-CTXs were resolved to consist of 14 rings and 62 C atoms, with multiple congeners isolated from carnivorous fish - C-CTX-1, C-CTX-2, C-CTX-1127, C-CTX-1141, C-CTX-1143, C-CTX-1157, C-CTX-1159 \cite{vernoux1997isolation,lewis1998structure,pottier2003identification,pottier2002characterisation}. Up to date, no C-CTXs have been isolated from any of the endemic \emph{Gambierdiscus} spp., however Fraga et al have shown that \emph{G. excentricus} from the Canary Islands produce CTX and MTX like compounds - the characterisation of these toxins is in process \cite{fraga2011gambierdiscus}. \\
The most recently discovered group CTXs is from the Indian ocean, where I-CTX-1, I-CTX-2, I-CTX-3 and I-CTX-4 were isolated from carnivorous fish. Their structure has not yet been elucidated, preventing classification to a sub type \cite{hamilton2002multiple,hamilton2002isolation}. It has been elucidated that they have a higher molecular weight in comparison to P-CTXs and C-CTXs \cite{caillaud2010update,hamilton2002multiple,hamilton2002isolation}. \\ %I-CTX-1 toxic to mice via intraperitoneal injection \cite{hamilton2002isolation}. 

It has been suggested that the evident variety of CTX congeners, found even in the same ecosystem, is due to modification to the toxin structure as it passes up the food chain which can increase potency up to 10-fold \cite{hokama1996human,lewis2006ciguatera}. This theory is backed by a study conducted by Mak et al, examining the CTX composition of different members of a ciguateric food web \cite{mak2013pacific}.

%Indigenous population's understanding of ciguateric fish may help prevent CFP. 
%Experiemntation of P-CTX-1 injeted into rats intravenously showed rapid distribution to tissue and high bioavailibility of toxin via Neuro2a assay

\subsection{MTX}

MTXs are the largest known proteinacious natural product \cite{yokoyama1988some,murata1993structure} and are highly toxic Ca$^{2+}$ channel activators with a LD$_{50}$ 0.05 $\mu$g/kg - there are only a couple of bacterial, proteinacious toxins with higher potency known \cite{yokoyama1988some,murata1993structure}. However the Ca$^{2+}$ activation is a secondary process of MTX activity, the primary mode of action in mammalian cells  is still unclear \cite{van2000diversity}. They are water soluble, polyether ladder compound first isolated form herbivorous Acanthurids fish gut in 1976 \cite{yasumoto1976toxicity}. Their complex structure and stereochemistry was elucidated in the 90s using stereoscopic studies and partial synthesis \cite{murata1993structure,murata1994structure,satake1995structural,nonomura1996complete,zheng1996complete}. \\
There are three isolated MTXs - designated MTX-1, MTX-2 and MTX-3, isolated from a \emph{Gambierdiscus} sp. in Queensland, Australia \cite{holmes1994purification}. The first two are structurally larger than the third and it is suspected, though unproven, that MTX-1 is synonymous with the MTX first isolated. \\ %who isolated it first? yokoyama? 
Initially in the 70s, MTXs were detected only in the guts of fish \cite{yasumoto1976toxicity}, so the prevalent theory that followed has been that they are irrelevant in CFP research due to the assumption that their water soluble nature would exclude them from being absorbed into flesh in concentrations relevant for bioaccumulation. This popular theory needs to be reconsidered, as earlier in the year a fish feeding study conducted by Kohli et al that demonstrated MTX were present in snapper liver, digestive organs and muscle in concentrations high enough to measure via LC-MS. In this study snapper were fed juvenile mullet, injected with a known quantity of \emph{G. australes} - a strain characterised to only produce MTX \cite{kohli2014feeding}. These findings make it imperative that the involvement of MTX in CFP, as well as the mode of action of MTX in humans, is established.

%insert gambieroxide
Recently, a new toxin has been isolated from \emph{G. toxicus} by Watanabe et al \cite{watanabe2013gambieroxide}. Gambieroxide's stereostructure has been elucidated by NMR and LC/MS/MS, concluding that it is structurally similar to yessotoxin (YTX) which is a lipophillic toxin found in filter feeding shellfish  \cite{tubaro2010yessotoxins}. Known producers of YTX are \emph{Protoceratium reticulatum}, \emph{Lingulodinium polyedrum} and \emph{Gonyaulax spinifera} \cite{tubaro2010yessotoxins} which are not  phylogenetically closely related to \emph{Gambierdiscus}. YTX h. In their structural paper, Watanabe et al state that the biological activity of gambieroxide will be reported at a later time point \cite{watanabe2013gambieroxide}.

\section{Toxcicity of different \emph{Gambierdiscus} species}
\emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. produce CTXs and MTXs \cite{murata1990structures,holmes1991strain,satake1993structure,holmes1994purification,satake1996isolation}, however, some wild and culturable strains have been recorded to not produce either or both toxins in measurable quantities \cite{gillespie1985significance,holmes1990toxicity}. Hence toxin production varies between species and even strains. Most studies were conducted in the 16 year time period pre-dating the discovery of \emph{G. belizeanus} in 1995 \cite{faust1995observation} and automatically fell under the caveat of the previously assumed type species \emph{Gambierdiscus toxicus}. Table xx shows known toxicity of each \emph{Gambierdiscus} species as detected via various essays and whether they have been characterised by LC-MS. 
The Caribbean species \emph{G. excentricus} was tested with a neuroblastoma cytotoxicity assay (N2A) which indicated both MTX and CTX toxicity \cite{fraga2011gambierdiscus}. However the toxin profile needs to be extrapolated with LC-MS.
Chinain et al identified the toxins produced by two strains of \emph{G. polynesiensis} with LC-MS. The major toxin produced was P-CTX-3C, other type II (M-seco-CTX-3C, 49-epi-CTX-3C) and type I (CTX-4A, CTX-4B) toxins were detected. The different strains produced the same toxins, but at different proportions \cite{chinain2010growth}. In an earlier study, Chinain et al detected toxicity of the water soluble fraction of \emph{G. polynesiensis} in a mouse bioassay (MBA), implicating MTX activity \cite{chinain1999morphology}. Rhodes et al produced contradictory evidence as they found no LC-MS measurable MTX in a Cook Island strain of \emph{G. polynesiensis} \cite{rhodes2014production}.
\emph{G. australes} extracts isolated by Rhodes et al indicated CTX and MTX presence by displaying toxic activity in both lipid and water soluble fractions when tested with MBA. However, LC-MS/MS analysis did not detect any CTXs and MTXs were not tested for. A follow up study on the same strain with LC-MS also found no CTXs, but potent MTX-3 like compounds were detected \cite{rhodes2014production,rhodes2010toxic}. In contrast, three different \emph{G. australes} strains isolated from French Polynesia, tested with RBA, produced P-CTX-3C like compounds \cite{chinain2010growth}. The Cook Islands isolate from Rhodes et al was tested against against a P-CTX-3C standard for LC-MS and came back negative \cite{rhodes2014production}. If the French Polynesian strains's RBA results are verified with LC-MS analysis, this could be a case in point for species specific, differential toxin production. 

These case studies show that while bioassays are important to indicate toxicity, LC-MS studies of every species need to be conducted to define their toxin profiles. Completing toxin characterisation for each individual species is imperative to ascertain the possible implication of species migration and HABs on CFP predictions and ecological impact. 
%check if recent LC_MS data for all species exists

\subsection{Pacific and Indian Ocean regions}
named after Gambier Islands, where firt identified \cite{adachi1979thecal}
\emph{G. toxicus, G. belizeanus, G. yasumotoi, G. australes, G. pacificus, G. polynesiensis, G. caribaeus, G. carpenteri} reported in Hawaii, Pacific Islands, Australia, South East Asia, Northern Indian Ocean %\cite{} table1.2
Three ribotypes suggesting new species found off coast f Japan \cite{nishimura2013genetic}
\emph{Gambierdiscus} of undetermined species found in Philippines \cite{gillespie1987possible} Hong kong \cite{lu2004harmful} Indonesia \cite{praseno1996hab} Mauritius \cite{hurbungs2002seasonal}. Also Mexican Pacific coast \cite{ceballos2006analisis} regions around Madagascar \cite{grzebyk1994ecology}. 
Reports of CFP in Madagascar with 20\% mortality rate \cite{habermehl1994severe}. CFP very common in Mexican-Carribean but not reflected in literature \cite{hernandez2004species}.
First \emph{G. toxicus} description in caribbean \cite{besada1982observations}.

\subsection{Atlantic Ocean region}
\emph{Gambierdiscus} was reported for the first time in 2003 near Crete in the Mediterranean Sea, as an alien species emigrating to a new habitat, which could herald an emerging region for CFP \cite{aligizaki2008morphological}.
early \emph{Gambierdiscus} look alike was spotted 1948 at Cape Verde Islands \cite{silva1956contribution} and 1979 Key Largos Florida \cite{taylor1979description}
\emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. been described from east coast of USA, Carribean and Mediterranean - see table 1.2 for ref.
\emph{Gambierdiscus} with species not defined reported at Cyprus, Rhodes and Saronikos Gulf \cite{aligizaki2009toxic,aligizaki2010diversity}, French West Indies \cite{lobel1988assessment}, Cuba \cite{delgado2006epiphytic}, Veracruz \cite{okolodkov2007seasonal}.
Central and South America not species specific: Costa Rica and Brazil (M. Montero pers. comm. in \cite{parsons2012gambierdiscus})
Africa not species specific: Angola \cite{berdalet2012global} but CFP reported in Canary Islands and Cameroon \cite{bienfang2008ciguatera} indicating \emph{Gambierdiscus} presence.

\subsubsection{Global distribution of \emph{Gambierdiscus} spp.}
%fix up with new info
\emph{Gambierdiscus} species have been classified as endemic to either Pacific or Atlantic \cite{berdalet2012global,litaker2010global}
Only in Pacific: \emph{G. australes} \emph{G. pacificus} %ref table 1.2
Only in Atlantic: \emph{G. ruetzleri} \emph{G. excentricus} \emph{Gambierdiscus} riobotype 1 and 2 %ref table 1.2
Both: \emph{G. belizeanus} \emph{G. caribeaus} \emph{G. carpenteri} \emph{G. carolinianus} \cite{litaker2010global,litaker2009taxonomy,berdalet2012global}
\emph{G. yasumotoi} Pacific but one report in Mexican-Carribean \cite{hernandez2004species} BUT before discovery of other globular species \emph{G. ruetzleri} which is distributed in Atlantic region \cite{litaker2009taxonomy}.
\emph{G. toxicus} distribution is dubious due to being default species in literature - often wrongly identified 
\emph{G. polynesiensis} found thrughout Pacific table 1.2 but once found near Canary Islands in Atlantic \cite{fraga2011gambierdiscus}
In hundreds of samples from Atlantic (Carribean/Gulf of Mexico/West Indies/Southeast US coast Florida to North Carolina), no Pacific-specific species have been detected \cite{berdalet2012global,litaker2010global}
Most of Pacific has not been sampled for \emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. so assertion cannot be made in return about Atlantic specific species.
compounded by under reporting and under sampling globally, and Pacific specifically, means that assertions about endemism or restricted distrubution can not be made conclusively.
Multiple \emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. can co-occur in a region eg Heron Island Australia, and found in isolation eg Merimbula where only \emph{G. carpenteri} is found %references? Merimbula data published yet?
Localised benthic blooms of \emph{Gambierdiscus} noted in literature in both Pacific and Atlantic regions \cite{nakajima1981toxicity,withers1984ciguatera,chinain1999seasonal,darius2007ciguatera}.
Cell density in blooms between 10,000 and 100,000 cell g$^{-1}$ wet weight algae \cite{litaker2010global}. No estimates for cell density of \emph{Gambierdiscus} which leads to CFP. Onset of CFP may be dependent on other factors too - species level variation in toxicity. Unidentified species of \emph{Gambierdiscus} found around Crete but no CFP outbreaks \cite{caillaud2010update}.
\emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. usually below 1,000 cells g$^{-1}$ wet weight algae \cite{litaker2010global} but in some locations those cell densities are consistent throughout the year \cite{chinain1999seasonal}.
Consistent exposure of low toxin concentration could cause CFP-related build up in fish. Need to understand relationship beween abundance and CFP outbreak. Benthic dinoflaggelate sampling is difficult due to sediments etc. Also \emph{Gambierdiscus} cell distribution can be uneven over small distances which causes difficulty in estimating large areas \cite{lobel1988assessment,ballantine1988population,litaker2010global}.

\section{Ciguatera fish poisoning /  food web?}

Ciguatera manifests as gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and neurological symptoms which can last weeks to months, years in severe cases, and be re-triggered by consumption of alcohol or certain foods \cite{lewis2006ciguatera}. 
\\

Ciguaterra poisoning is responsible for 80 – 96 \% of human poisoning from consuming fish and estimated at around 500 000 cases a year \cite{grandjean2008centers}, however correct diagnosis is problematic. It relies on the medical professional connecting the symptoms with recent fish consumption while eliminating other possible marine poison. In Queensland alone it is estimated that less that 20 \% of cases are reported \cite{lewis2006ciguatera}.\\

The symptoms of CFP can vary widely with a myriad of symptoms. Adams produces a detailed report of eight people contracting CFP from the same meal, hence assumed the same toxin profile, but eliciting varied symptoms and length of the condition \cite{adams1993outbreak}.


The distribution of P-CTX-1, P-CTX-2 and P-CTX-3 in a ciguateric reef system has been elucidated by Mak et al, with emphasis on biotransformation of P-CTX as it moves through the food web as well as importance of species/genus specific dietary habits impacting the P-CTX concentration of fishes \cite{mak2013pacific}.
Essential to elucidate the presence of CTX in lower trophic level of the food web to predict in which genera bioaccumulation is likely \cite{mak2013pacific}
A study conducted in ciguateric reef systems in the Republic of Kiribati tracked the components of the food web part of CTX bioaccumulation. Of samples tested, 54\% of herbivorous, 72\% of omnivorous and 76\% of carnivorous fish tested positive for P-CTX presence. Grazers predominantly exhibited P-CTX-2 while the principal CTX found in piscivorous fish was P-CTX-1 \cite{mak2013pacific}.

\section{Detection of CTX and MTX in seafood}
% epic table 1.4
Name of ciguatera derived from "cigua", native Cubans description of a turban shelled snail and implicated in outbreak of sickness in Spanish explorers in 1500s \cite{gudger1930poisonous}. CTX in turban snail \emph{Turbo argyrstoma} confirmed \cite{yasumoto1976toxicity}.
Majority cases reported from large reef fish, eg. \cite{hokama2001ciguatera,lewis2001changing,dechraoui2005use,laurent2005ciguatera}, major factor in diagnostics due to rare retention of fish sample for testing.
Estimated less than 20\% of CFP cases reported globally \cite{dickey2010ciguatera}. Common misdiagnosis for CFP likely due to excess of 175 symptoms\cite{sims1987theoretical}, potential variance of symptoms with portion size \cite{wong2008features}, individual susceptibility or toxin accumulation with age \cite{bagnis1979clinical,glaziou1993study} and could be associated with other illnesses such as decompression sickness \cite{adams1993outbreak}, chronic fatigue syndrome, multiple sclerosis \cite{lindsay1997chronic,ting2001ciguatera} and brain tumours \cite{lindsay1997chronic}.
several hundred fish species implicated in CFP \cite{}. %need ref from gurjeet
With presumed under reporting and other limitations mentioned, compounded by absence of an adequate commercial test kit, cannot express exact figure for number of cases. Carnivorous fish are main cause of CFP, however herbivorous fish (eg. surgeonfish, parrotfish pose important accumulative intermediate in food chain \cite{cruz2006macroalgal,randall1958review}.
Table 4: summary of over 90 fish species and other marine fauna which have tested positive for CTX from ciguatera prone regions and following reported outbreaks. Mostly mid-latitude tropical and sub-tropical zones, fitting with \emph{Gambierdiscus} distribution in Table 2.
CFP also reported in no-endemic areas due to increased seafood import \cite{glaziou1994epidemiology,ting2001ciguatera}. Studies predominantly focus on large reef fish, but toxin accumulation detected in eels, sea cucumbers, sarfish, seals and jelly fish. %ref in table 2
Sharks suspected after CFP outbreak but no remnant samples left availible for testing \cite{boisier1995fatal,lehane2000ciguatera}. Urgent requirement to fill deficit of knowledge regarding species other than fish as coastal toxin vectors.
CTX is focus for CFP studies rather than in conjunction with MTX.
MBA used to confirm MTX in \emph{Ctenochaetus striatus} (striped bristletooth) \cite{bagnis1987use} %this article is about CTX only - MTX not mentioned in text.
knowledge gap: do MTX bioaccumulate up the food chain? and role in CFP?
on small island nations, native fisherman know ciguatera prone zones and fish species to avoid. However in French Polynesia, CTX detected in fish considered to be safe \cite{darius2007ciguatera}.
Toxin profiles and structures elucidated via chromatographic techniques such as HPCL, UPLC and LC-MS with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) \cite{legrand1989isolation,murata1990structures,murata1990structures,satake1996isolation} and radio ligand binding (RLB) \cite{hamilton2002multiple,hamilton2002isolation}. Effective methods, however expensive and require special training - ie not routine in the field and unlikely to become so. 
toxin confirmation via UPLC/HPLC then LC-MS: isolation and fractionation of CTX to compare against their known molecular weights (table 3). Rapid analysis method proposed \cite{lewis2009rapid}, however acquisition of standards difficult due to limited natural CTX compounds \cite{berdalet2012global} and synthetic production is possible \cite{hirama2001total} although highly complex. Lacking consistent source for reference, reliable quantification of CTX and congeners is not possible. Compounding problem is co-elution peaks of similar compounds; inhibiting/promoting matrixes remain unresolved.
Biological assays for ciguateric fish detection using chickens \cite{}, cats \cite{larson1967ciguatera}, mongooses \cite{hokama1977radioimmunoassay},diptera larvae \cite{labrousse1996toxicological}, brine shrimp \cite{granade1976ciguatera} and mosquitoes \cite{bagnis1987use}. Each essay problematic due to toxin specificity and quantification, inefficiencies, ethical considerations summary: \cite{dickey2010ciguatera}
MBA via intraperitoneal injection most commonly used bioassay (see table 4) even though it does not provide linear dose-response relationship with CTX toxicity \cite{hoffman1983mouse}. 
Many alternative biochemical assays proposed to replace biological assays for sea food testing. Radioimmunoassay \cite{hokama1977radioimmunoassay} preceeded the financially more viable as well as higher throughput enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) \cite{hokama1983rapid}, has been refined to reliably detect picogram concentration of CTX in fish tissue \cite{campora2008detection,campora2010evaluating}.
Stick enzyme immunoassay (SEIA) \cite{hokama1985rapid} and solid phase immunoassay (SPIA) \cite{hokama1990simplified} progressed to the development of commercial kits (i.e. Cigua-check\textregistered \ and Ciguatect\textregistered), although these have yielded a considerable amount of false positives and false negatives \cite{wong2005study}. Cigua-check\textregistered \ is no longer manufactured.
Alternate screening options are sodium channel binding (N2A) \cite{dickey2010ciguatera} and RBA \cite{poli1997identification,darius2007ciguatera} which are both recommended by European Food Standard Association \cite{} %ummm... check this shit out
Alternate assays do not discern between specific CTX and MTX congeners; need development and validation via LC-MS analysis. Problems impacting progress: lack of available purified standards \cite{}, different toxin congeners and unidentified metabolites produced by \emph{Gambierdiscus} in fish samples \cite{endean1993variation,vernoux1997isolation}.
Kohli et al. detected the presence of \emph{G. australes} in the viscera of snapper via nested PCR. This could provide an effective, inexpensive and widely established method to detect whether suspected ciguateric fish have consumed \emph{Gambierdiscus}, and furthermore this approach can be species specific giving an indication to the possible toxin profile present in the fish \cite{kohli2014feeding}. 

Studies pertaining to the toxcicity of \emph{Gambierdicus} towards copepods and their nauplii were conducted \cite{lee2014toxicity}, as copepds feed on microalgae attached to macroalgae. They could constitute the primary consumers in the food chain, which can lead to toxin accumulation \cite{raisuddin2007copepod} resulting in CFP. The impact of \emph{G. yasumotoi} on the model copepod \emph{Tigriopus japonicus} was assessed in a study conducted by Lee et al, finding that the presence of \emph{G. yasumotoi} cells, or to a lesser extent growth media stock, cause immobility and mortality on adult copepods, where increased \emph{G. yasumotoi} concentration increased the effect. Furthermore nauplii were affected at lower concentrations \cite{lee2014toxicity}.
It has been shown that ciguatera toxins passing through the food chain in the Pacific undergo biotransformation. Some modifications can increase the potency of the toxins up to 10-fold, compared to the toxin produced by \textit{G.toxicus} \cite{lewis2006ciguatera}.

In 2005 Hung et al established that the CFP of three family members was caused by CTX present in baracuda fish eggs \cite{hung2005persistent}. This indicates that bioaccumulated CTX can be passed on to offspring which start their life cycle with a symptom inducing concentration of CTX.
