\section{Introduction}
% HABs, testing shit
Harmful algal bloom-forming dinoflagellates have become an increasingly observed phenomena on the global scale. They cause oxygen depletion which limits its availability to other organisms, block sunlight for the benthos and potentially produce harmful compounds \cite{grandjean2008centers}, an example for the latter is \emph{Gambierdiscus spp.} \cite{lehane2000ciguatera}. This genus is especially prevalent in the literature as they produce toxins responsible for ciguatera fish	poisoning (CFP)	in humans through bioaccumulation in tropical and sub-tropical fish. It is classically reported in regions bordering on the Pacific and Indian ocean, however in the last decade \emph{G. toxicus} has been found as far into the northern hemisphere as the Mediterranean Sea. This expansion of habitat may be due t global warming \cite{aligizaki2008morphological}. \
A study correlating CFP related calls from the US national poison centre data with storms and sea surface temperature, this showed that sea surface temperature was a relevant factor for CFP incidence and extrapolate that climate change related sea temperature rise could escalate CFP by 200 - 400 \% in the US alone \cite{garces2012habitat}

% history, species confusion, differenc ein toxicity within same species
Vast diversity of phytoplankton recently discovered at varying taxonomic levels \cite{simon2009diversity}. 
New molecular methods promise many more species to be documented \cite{murray2012genetic,murray2012transcriptomics}.
Currently only 160 described benthic dinoflagellates \cite{taylor2008dinoflagellate} %check plus explain benthic
Benthic dinoflagellate implicated in CFP in 1977 sparked interest in this phylum \cite{yasumoto1977finding}.
Genus \emph{Gambierdiscus} named after location first sampled, Gmabier Islands in French Polynesia, long believed to be monophyletic with \emph{Gambierdiscus toxicus} \cite{adachi1979thecal} %when were more species discovered?
\emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. produce ciguatoxins (CTX) and maitotoxins (MTX) \cite{chinain1997intraspecific,chinain1999morphology,chinain1999seasonal,chinain2010growth,holmes1998gambierdiscus,rhodes2010toxic,fraga2011gambierdiscus,holland2013differences}
CFP most common nonbacterial illness associated with fish consumption \cite{friedman2008ciguatera} %rephrase
CFP cases 50,000 - 500,000 /year globally \cite{fleming1998seafood}.
CTX orally accumulative from herbivorous and carnivorous fish consumption causing CFP \cite{bagnis1979clinical,gillespie1987possible,sims1987theoretical} %MTX implicatd in any of these or was that just Gurjeet setting up his work?
Increase in HAB events reported globally \cite{hallegraeff2010ocean} % HAB impact on enviro and humans: \cite{garces2012habitat}
CFP increase of 60\% in last decade in Pacific Islands \cite{skinner2011ciguatera}
New \emph{Gambierdiscus} species discovered, evidence that they may all have individual toxin profiles \cite{chinain2010growth,fraga2011gambierdiscus,holland2013differences}
In other dinoflagellates, toxin producton varies at species level and within species.
HAB species are monitored for early detection of CFP outbreak.
Climate change is impacting the marine environment - a model ocean for changing conditions is the Mediterranean Sea \cite{lejeusne2010climate}, where \emph{Gambierdiscus} has extended it's habitat to since the early 2000s \cite{aligizaki2008morphological}.

Ciguatera manifests as gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and neurological symptoms which can last weeks to months, years in severe cases, and be re-triggered by consumption of alcohol or certain foods \cite{lewis2006ciguatera}. 
\\

Ciguaterra poisoning is responsible for 80 – 96 \% of human poisoning from consuming fish and estimated at around 500 000 cases a year \cite{grandjean2008centers}, however correct diagnosis is problematic. It relies on the medical professional connecting the symptoms with recent fish consumption while eliminating other possible marine poison. In Queensland alone it is estimated that less that 20 \% of cases are reported \cite{lewis2006ciguatera}.\\

The symptoms of CFP can vary widely with a myriad of symptoms. Adams produces a detailed report of eight people contracting CFP from the same meal, hence assumed the same toxin profile, but eliciting varied symptoms and length of the condition \cite{adams1993outbreak}.


The distribution of P-CTX-1, P-CTX-2 and P-CTX-3 in a ciguateric reef system has been elucidated by Mak et al, with emphasis on biotransformation of P-CTX as it moves through the food web as well as importance of species/genus specific dietary habits impacting the P-CTX concentration of fishes \cite{mak2013pacific}.
Essential to elucidate the presence of CTX in lower trophic level of the food web to predict in which genera bioaccumulation is likely \cite{mak2013pacific}
A study conducted in ciguateric reef systems in the Republic of Kiribati tracked the components of the food web part of CTX bioaccumulation. Of samples tested, 54\% of herbivorous, 72\% of omnivorous and 76\% of carnivorous fish tested positive for P-CTX presence. Grazers predominantly exhibited P-CTX-2 while the principal CTX found in piscivorous fish was P-CTX-1 \cite{mak2013pacific}.

Localised benthic blooms of \emph{Gambierdiscus} noted in literature in both Pacific and Atlantic regions \cite{nakajima1981toxicity,withers1984ciguatera,chinain1999seasonal,darius2007ciguatera}.
Cell density in blooms between 10,000 and 100,000 cell g$^{-1}$ wet weight algae \cite{litaker2010global}. No estimates for cell density of \emph{Gambierdiscus} which leads to CFP. Onset of CFP may be dependent on other factors too - species level variation in toxicity. Unidentified species of \emph{Gambierdiscus} found around Crete but no CFP outbreaks \cite{caillaud2010update}.
\emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. usually below 1,000 cells g$^{-1}$ wet weight algae \cite{litaker2010global} but in some locations those cell densities are consistent throughout the year \cite{chinain1999seasonal}.
Consistent exposure of low toxin concentration could cause CFP-related build up in fish. Need to understand relationship beween abundance and CFP outbreak. Benthic dinoflaggelate sampling is difficult due to sediments etc. Also \emph{Gambierdiscus} cell distribution can be uneven over small distances which causes difficulty in estimating large areas \cite{lobel1988assessment,ballantine1988population,litaker2010global}.
Distributed in coastal zones at tropical and subtropical latitudes.


Multiple \emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. can co-occur in a region eg Heron Island Australia, and found in isolation eg Merimbula where only \emph{G. carpenteri} is found %references? Merimbula data published yet?

\section{Morphology and phylogenetics of \emph{Gambierdiscus}}

When \emph{Gambierdiscus} was first described by Adachi and Fukuyo in 1979 it was believed to be a monotypic taxon with \emph{G. toxicus} as it's sole representative \cite{adachi1979thecal}. Inconsistency in morphology and toxicity were observed which led to another species discovery 15 years later, which was compounded by differences in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes \cite{faust1995observation,holmes1990toxicity,holmes1991strain,chinain1997intraspecific,richlen2008phylogeography,bomber1988epiphytic,bomber1989epiphytism,bomber1989genitic,morton1993response}. Currently xx species and xx ribotypes have been described, as per table xx, based on their distinct morphological and genetic characteristics. New discovery of species with increased global sampling is likely. \\

The ensuing descriptions contain an overview of the main morphological characteristics for currently described \emph{Gambierdiscus} sp., the terminology used has been conformed to the proposed terms from Hoppenrath et al \cite{hoppenrath2013taxonomy}. The initial species description detailed \emph{Gambierdiscus} to be large (60-100 $\mu$m), armoured with a distinct plate pattern and fishhook shaped apical pore. Species fall into two categories - antero-posteriorly compressed, also described as lenticulr, or slightly laterally compressed, or globular, as per figure xx. To date there are only two globular species (\emph{G. yasumotoi} and \emph{G. ruetzleri}) which can be distinguished from each other by cell size, size and 2' apical and 2'''' antapical plate and the depth to width ratio as per Litaker et al. \cite{litaker2009taxonomy}. \\
The other species are antero-posteriorly compressed and further divided by the 1p posterior intercalary plate being narrow (\emph{G. australes}, \emph{G. belizeanus}, \emph{G. pacificus} and \emph{G. excentricus}) or broad (\emph{G. polynesiensis}, \emph{G. carolinianus}, \emph{G. toxicus}, \emph{G. caribaeus} and \emph{G. carpenteri}). \\
The narrow 1p posterior intercalary plated species are subdivided by heavily aerolated (\emph{G. belizeanus}) and smooth cell surfaces (\emph{G. australes}, \emph{excentricus} and \emph{pacificus}).Further distinction for smooth plated species can be drawn from the shape of the 2' apical plate, which can be hatchet shaped (\emph{G. pacificus}) or rectangular ( \emph{G.australes} and \emph{G. excentricus}). The convential rectangularly shaped 2' apical plated species can be differentiated by size - where \emph{G. excentricus} is 1.5 times wider and deeper than \emph{G. australes}, as well as other features described in their initial desctiptions \cite{chinain1999morphology,fraga2011gambierdiscus}. \\
Species within the broad 1p posterior intercalary plate category can be set apart by posessing a rectangular shaped 2' apical plate (\emph{G. caribeaus} and \emph{G. carpenteri}) or a hatchet shaped 2' apical plate (\emph{G. carolinianus}. \emph{G. polynesiensis} and \emph{G. toxicus}).
\emph{G. toxicus} can be discerned by a pointed dorsal end to the 1p posterior intercalary plate. \emph{G. carolineanus} and \emph{polynesiensis} can be differentiated as outlined by Litaker et al \cite{litaker2009taxonomy}. The rectangluarly shaped 2' apical plate posessing species \emph{G. caribaeus} and \emph{G. carpentri} can be differentiated by the shape of the 4'' precingular plate, which is symetric and asymetric respectively. \\
Other morphological distinctions, such as the size and shape of the sulcal plates can be found in the original descriptions as well as Litaker et al's account \cite{litaker2009taxonomy,fraga2011gambierdiscus,faust1995observation,holmes1998gambierdiscus,chinain1999morphology}. %insert new species shit
These features can be readily observed using light and scanning electron microscopy. However the strain specific variability of morphology within species, such as in size and shape of individual plates, makes this a support tool for classification which should be verified with genetic analysis. \\ %insert more spin, especially what Shauna said 

An essential tool for genetic analysis to discern between the different species of \emph{Gambierdiscus} is rRNA analysis, specifically comparing regions of the large subunit (LSU) rRNA, small subunit (SSU) rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rRNA. From such analysis, the current consensus is that \emph{Gambierdiscus} is monophyletic, with the lenticular and globular species forming two distinct clades \cite{chinain1999morphology,litaker2009taxonomy,fraga2011gambierdiscus,richlen2008phylogeography,kuno2010genetic,litaker2010global,nishimura2013genetic}. \\
Phylogentic analysis concluded that the globular clade containing \emph{G. ruetzleri} and \emph{G. yasumotoi} diverged early in the genus' evolution \cite{litaker2009taxonomy,nishimura2013genetic}. The two species are also the most closely related within the genus.

\section{Toxins produced by \emph{Gambierdiscus}}
%table 1.3 - amend with new info
% toxin mod in the food chain - or seperate section?
%\emph{G. toxicus} has been shown to produce a range of toxins other than ciguatoxins \cite{holmes1994purification,murata1993structure} Furthermore, other species within this genus produce ciguatoxin like substances, such as \emph{G. polynesiensis}, \emph{G. australes} and \emph{G. pacificus} \cite{roeder2010characteristic}. 

%trediculous symptomology detailed in sims1987theoretical

Ciguateric seafood is characteristically impossible to discern during culinary preparation as it does not exhibit any obviously recognisable differences to non toxic specimens and is heat resistant \cite{withers1982ciguatera}. Hence toxin presence is usually only diagnosed retrospectively from CFP symptoms in conjunction with recent seafood consumption \cite{sims1987theoretical} as samples of the food consumed are rarely obtained. Due to diagnosis depending on the deductive capability of the medical professional, CFP is predicted to be widely under reported with as little of 20 \% of cases being reported  in Queensland, Australia, alone \cite{lewis2006ciguatera}. The disease can manifest as over 180 symptoms, with varying levels of severity, and differ even between individuals at the same time and source of exposure \cite{sims1987theoretical}. The effects of the disease appear to be cumulative as severity increases with previous exposure \cite{emerson1983preliminary}. Commonly a couple hours after consumption, the initial symptoms are gastrointestinal which can be followed by cardiovascular and neurological manifestations \cite{sims1987theoretical}. They can persist between weeks to years, and recurrence is a common phenomenon induced by a variety of factors such as alcohol, fish or meat consumption \cite{lewis2006ciguatera} as well as sexual activity \cite{lange1992travel}. \\
Symptoms of CFP can vary between geographical locations \cite{molgo2000ciguatera,dickey2010ciguatera}, which likely contributes to the inefficiency of diagnosis. This could be de to the structural difference between CTXs, indeed and or MTXs. Hence accurate determination of CTX and MTX congeners is vital to understanding toxicology, for linked risks and symptoms symptoms of CFP - which is an avenue of investigation that urgently needs attention.\\

In 1979 the great breakthrough in understanding CFP was that an algal species, \emph{G. toxicus}, produces the toxins that cause the disease and that the toxins bioaccumulate up the food chain \citep{adachi1979thecal}. With the advent of further species discovery from 1995 onwards \cite{faust1995observation}, the inconsistency in toxin measurements between isolates tested started to make sense - they are different species. The current challenge is to characterise the species specific toxin profiles, employing a consistent and conclusive methodology. Bioassays provide an excellent indicator to a species' toxicity, however it does not suffice to elucidate a detailed toxin profile - liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) or tandem LC-MS/MS analysis is required \cite{diogened2014chemistry}. \emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. produce more than just CTXs - notably MTXs are also commonly registered \cite{holmes1994purification,murata1993structure}. It has, until recently, been assumed in the literature that CTXs are the sole culprit in CFP as MTXs are water soluble. CTXs have been isolated form the Pacific, Caribbean and the Indian ocean. The  structure varies between the Pacific and the Caribbean congeners, with the structures of the Indian ocean analogues still to be determined. Symptomatology of CFP varies between the three regions, however if the variance is dependent on  the structural difference, or for example due to different precursor modification during biomagnification, is yet to be determined \cite{lewis2006ciguatera}. Understanding the molecular evolution and ecology of the toxins, coupled with which species produce them and under what circumstances, are points that are essential to dealing with harmful algal blooms and their impact on humans and the environment. Whether and which changing environmental cues play a role is imperative for predictive purposes with the advent of global warming \cite{llewellyn2010revisiting}.  \\

\subsection{CTX}
Toxins in the CTX family consist of lipid soluble polyether ladders which act as sodium channel activators \cite{dechraoui1999ciguatoxins}. They are orally effective in humans at the pM and mM concentration range \cite{molgo2000ciguatera}, causing an influx of Na$^{+}$ ions and hence spontaneous action potentials in the cell, especially active on voltage sensitive channels along the nodes of Ranvier \cite{sims1987theoretical,mattei1999neurotoxins,lewis1992action,molgo2000ciguatera}. \\	   
Currently CTXs are prefixed by their origin, where members from the Pacific, Caribbean and Indian ocean are designated P-CTX, C-CTX and I-CTX respectively. % don't know C-PTX subdivision ref... for P-CTX it's \cite{} I-CYX is\cite}
The congeners are further subdivided on a structural basis into type I and type II within P-CTXs, followed by all C-CTXs as type III - the molecular structure of I-CTXs have not been elucidated to such an extent as to assign a type \cite{legrand1997two,hamilton2002multiple,hamilton2002isolation}, An overview of the designations can be found in table x.  \\
Type I P-CTXs consist of 13 rings with 60 C atoms \cite{murata1990structures,lewis1991purification,lewis1993origin}, including the first completely defined CTX which was isolated from moray eels and designated P-CTX-1B \cite{murata1990structures} or also described as CTX-1 \cite{lewis1991purification}. P-CTX-2 and P-CTX-3 were isolated from the same extracts but exhibited an alternate structure and toxicity in mice \cite{lewis1991purification}. It has been suggested by two research groups that P-CTX-1, P-CTX-2 and P-CTX-3 may be derivatives from the dinoflagellate precursors CTX-4A and CTX-4B (also GTX-4B by Murata et al \cite{murata1990structures}) \cite{lewis1993origin,yasumoto2000structural}. So far, P-CTX-4A and P-CTX-4B have been isolated from \emph{Gambierdiscus polynesiensis} culture extracts \cite{chinain2010growth}, while P-CTX-1, P-CTX-2 and P-CTX-3 have not. \\
The structure for type II P-CTX-3C consists of 13 ring and 57 C atoms and has been isolated first from \emph{Gambierdiscus} culture \cite{satake1993structure}, then from \emph{G. polynesiensis} \cite{chinain2010growth}. There are two known congeners of P-CTX-3C which have been isolated - 49-epi-CTX-3C (or CTX-3B by Chinain et al \cite{chinain2010growth}) and M-seco-CTX-3C from \emph{Gambierdiscus} \cite{satake1993structure} and \emph{G. polynesiensis} \cite{chinain2010growth}. Two type II CTXs have been isolated from Moray eel, 2,3-dihydroxy-CTX-3C (or CTX-2A1) and 51-hydroxy-CTX-3C \cite{satake1998isolation}, and are suspected to constitute oxygenated metabolites of P-CTX-3. \\ %\cite{yasumoto2000structural} check ref as well as if P-CTX3 or P-CTX-3C 
Structurally C-CTXs were resolved to consist of 14 rings and 62 C atoms, with multiple congeners isolated from carnivorous fish - C-CTX-1, C-CTX-2, C-CTX-1127, C-CTX-1141, C-CTX-1143, C-CTX-1157, C-CTX-1159 \cite{vernoux1997isolation,lewis1998structure,pottier2003identification,pottier2002characterisation}. Up to date, no C-CTXs have been isolated from any of the endemic \emph{Gambierdiscus} spp., however Fraga et al have shown that \emph{G. excentricus} from the Canary Islands produce CTX and MTX like compounds - the characterisation of these toxins is in process \cite{fraga2011gambierdiscus}. \\
The most recently discovered group CTXs is from the Indian ocean, where I-CTX-1, I-CTX-2, I-CTX-3 and I-CTX-4 were isolated from carnivorous fish. Their structure has not yet been elucidated, preventing classification to a sub type \cite{hamilton2002multiple,hamilton2002isolation}.

It has been suggested that the evident variety of CTX congeners, found even in the same ecosystem, is due to modification to the toxin structure as it passes up the food chain which can increase potency up to 10-fold \cite{hokama1996human,lewis2006ciguatera}. This theory is backed by a study conducted by Mak et al, examining the CTX composition of different members of a ciguateric food web \cite{mak2013pacific}.

\subsection{MTX}

MTXs are the largest known proteinacious natural product \cite{yokoyama1988some,murata1993structure} and are highly toxic Ca$^{2+}$ channel activators with a LD$_{50}$ 0.05 $\mu$g/kg - there are only a couple of bacterial, proteinacious toxins with higher potency known \cite{yokoyama1988some,murata1993structure}. However the Ca$^{2+}$ activation is a secondary process of MTX activity, the primary mode of action in mammalian cells  is still unclear \cite{van2000diversity}. They are water soluble, polyether ladder compound first isolated form herbivorous Acanthurids fish gut in 1976 \cite{yasumoto1976toxicity}. Their complex structure and stereochemistry was elucidated in the 90s using stereoscopic studies and partial synthesis \cite{murata1993structure,murata1994structure,satake1995structural,nonomura1996complete,zheng1996complete}. \\
There are three isolated MTXs - designated MTX-1, MTX-2 and MTX-3, isolated from a \emph{Gambierdiscus} sp. in Queensland, Australia \cite{holmes1994purification}. The first two are structurally larger than the third and it is suspected, though unproven, that MTX-1 is synonymous with the MTX first isolated. \\ %who isolated it first? yokoyama? 
Initially in the 70s, MTXs were detected only in the guts of fish \cite{yasumoto1976toxicity}, so the prevalent theory that followed has been that they are irrelevant in CFP research due to the assumption that their water soluble nature would exclude them from being absorbed into flesh in concentrations relevant for bioaccumulation. This popular theory needs to be reconsidered, as earlier in the year a fish feeding study conducted by Kohli et al that demonstrated MTX were present in snapper liver, digestive organs and muscle in concentrations high enough to measure via LC-MS. In this study snapper were fed juvenile mullet, injected with a known quantity of \emph{G. australes} - a strain characterised to only produce MTX \cite{kohli2014feeding}. These findings make it imperative that the involvement of MTX in CFP, as well as the mode of action of MTX in humans, is established.

Recently, a new toxin has been isolated from \emph{G. toxicus} by Watanabe et al \cite{watanabe2013gambieroxide}. Gambieroxide's stereostructure has been elucidated by NMR and LC/MS/MS, concluding that it is structurally similar to yessotoxin (YTX) which is a lipophillic toxin found in filter feeding shellfish  \cite{tubaro2010yessotoxins}. Known producers of YTX are \emph{Protoceratium reticulatum}, \emph{Lingulodinium polyedrum} and \emph{Gonyaulax spinifera} \cite{tubaro2010yessotoxins} which are not  phylogenetically closely related to \emph{Gambierdiscus}.
- In their structural paper, Watanabe et al state that the biological activity of gambieroxide will be reported at a later time point \cite{watanabe2013gambieroxide}.

\section{Toxcicity of different \emph{Gambierdiscus} species}
\emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. produce CTXs and MTXs \cite{murata1990structures,holmes1991strain,satake1993structure,holmes1994purification,satake1996isolation}, however, some wild and culturable strains have been recorded to not produce either or both toxins in measurable quantities \cite{gillespie1985significance,holmes1990toxicity}. Hence toxin production varies between species and even strains. Most studies were conducted in the 16 year time period pre-dating the discovery of \emph{G. belizeanus} in 1995 \cite{faust1995observation} and automatically fell under the caveat of the previously assumed type species \emph{Gambierdiscus toxicus}. Table xx shows known toxicity of each \emph{Gambierdiscus} species as detected via various essays and whether they have been characterised by LC-MS. \\
The Caribbean species \emph{G. excentricus} was tested with a neuroblastoma cytotoxicity assay (N2A) which indicated both MTX and CTX toxicity \cite{fraga2011gambierdiscus}. However the toxin profile needs to be extrapolated with LC-MS.
Chinain et al identified the toxins produced by two strains of \emph{G. polynesiensis} with LC-MS. The major toxin produced was P-CTX-3C, other type II (M-seco-CTX-3C, 49-epi-CTX-3C) and type I (CTX-4A, CTX-4B) toxins were detected. The different strains produced the same toxins, but at different proportions \cite{chinain2010growth}. In an earlier study, Chinain et al detected toxicity of the water soluble fraction of \emph{G. polynesiensis} in a mouse bioassay (MBA), implicating MTX activity \cite{chinain1999morphology}. Rhodes et al produced contradictory evidence as they found no LC-MS measurable MTX in a Cook Island strain of \emph{G. polynesiensis} \cite{rhodes2014production}.
\emph{G. australes} extracts isolated by Rhodes et al indicated CTX and MTX presence by displaying toxic activity in both lipid and water soluble fractions when tested with MBA. However, LC-MS/MS analysis did not detect any CTXs and MTXs were not tested for. A follow up study on the same strain with LC-MS also found no CTXs, but potent MTX-3 like compounds were detected \cite{rhodes2014production,rhodes2010toxic}. In contrast, three different \emph{G. australes} strains isolated from French Polynesia, tested with RBA, produced P-CTX-3C like compounds \cite{chinain2010growth}. The Cook Islands isolate from Rhodes et al was tested against against a P-CTX-3C standard for LC-MS and came back negative \cite{rhodes2014production}. If the French Polynesian strains's RBA results are verified with LC-MS analysis, this could be a case in point for species specific, differential toxin production. \\
Holland et al conducted a large scale two year toxicity screening of 56 strains from 6 species of \emph{G. belizeanus, G. caribaeus, G. carolinianus, G. carpenteri, G. rutzleri} and  \emph{Gambierdiscus} ribotype 2, using human erythrocyte lysis assay (HELA) \cite{holland2013differences}. Haemolytic activity is a well established property of MTX \cite{igarashi1999mechanisms}, which is the implication from Holland's study. It showed that the haemolytic activity varied marginally between strains but stayed consistent for each strain over the two year sampling period, indicating that MTX production, and congener suite, varies between the species but remains consistent over time \cite{holland2013differences}.
In contrast, a recent study of CTX-like toxicity using mouse neuroblastoma assay (MNA) of the new \emph{Gambiersiscus} ribotypes 4, 5 and 6 found that the isolates from a ciguateric site were up to 4\- fold more toxic compared to isolates from a geographycally closely related non-ciguateric reference site \cite{xu2014distribution}. This observed difference in MTX and CTX production staying constant and varying respectively, could be due to CTX production increasing in a ciguateric setting, or something other than temperature variation changes MTX production. The findings of both of these studies need to be verified with LC-MS. \\
These case studies show that while bioassays are important to indicate toxicity, LC-MS studies of every species need to be conducted to define their toxin profiles. Completing toxin characterisation for each individual species is imperative to ascertain the possible implication of species migration and HABs on CFP predictions and ecological impact.

% global map with references - GEOHAB report too close?

%difference in CTXs

Some \emph{Gambierdiscus} species have been classified as endemic to either Pacific or Atlantic, while others have been found globally distributed \cite{berdalet2012global,litaker2010global}. Due to the relatively recent progress regarding the phylogeny within the genus as well as the continued discovery of new species, understanding about \emph{Gambierdiscus} distribution and abundance is fragmentary, asper table xx. \\
Species identified only in the Pacific include \emph{G. australes} and \emph{G. pacificus}, while Atlantic endemic species are \emph{G. ruetzleri} \emph{G. excentricus} \emph{Gambierdiscus} riobotype 1 and 2. Species found in both regions include \emph{G. belizeanus} \emph{G. caribeaus} \emph{G. carpenteri} \emph{G. carolinianus} \cite{litaker2010global,litaker2009taxonomy,berdalet2012global}. %incl new data! \\
The global distribution and abundance of \emph{Gambierdiscus} is not well understood. The primary contributing factor to this uncertainty is the default species designation of \emph{G. toxicus} over decades. Detangling the phylogeny of \emph{Gambierdiscus} was initiated by Litaker et al in 2009 based on morphology and genetic markers \cite{litaker2009taxonomy}. Since then, several new species types and ribotypes have been recorded. To consolidate the phylogeny, genetic analysis needs to be consistently employed. Potentially older data may need to be ignored as some species appear morphologically identical, which raises the question whether previously identified species were correctly classified, especially if the classification was dependent on morphology.
For example, \emph{G. yasumotoi} has been primarily reported in the Pacific, except for one report in the Mexican-Carribean \cite{hernandez2004species}. However this record preceeds the discovery of the other globular species \emph{G. ruetzleri}, which is endemic to the Atlantic region \cite{litaker2009taxonomy}. However a recent report of this species at the southern Kuwait coast and the Gulf of Aqaba in Jordan \cite{saburova2013new}, could indicate that this species is globally distributed also \cite{xu2014distribution}.
Similarly, \emph{G. polynesiensis} found throughout Pacific table 1.2 but once found near Canary Islands in Atlantic \cite{fraga2011gambierdiscus}. \\
Another considerable factor hindering the elucidation of abundance an distribution is sampling infrequency and inconsistent between the regions. In the hundreds of samples from Atlantic (Carribean/Gulf of Mexico/West Indies/Southeast US coast Florida to North Carolina), no Pacific-specific species have been detected \cite{berdalet2012global,litaker2010global}. However most of Pacific has not been sampled for \emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. so a similar conclusion about Atlantic species in the Pacific cannot be made and assertions about endemism or restricted distrubution can not be made conclusively.

\subsection{Pacific and Indian Ocean regions}
The genus is named after Gambier Islands in French Polynesia, where it was first identified \cite{adachi1979thecal} and shortly after in the Caribbean \cite{besada1982observations}.
\emph{G. toxicus, G. belizeanus, G. yasumotoi, G. australes, G. pacificus, G. polynesiensis, G. caribaeus, G. carpenteri} reported in Hawaii, Pacific Islands, Australia, South East Asia, Northern Indian Ocean.
\emph{G. sacabrosus} and two new \emph{Gambierdiscus} ribotypes have been reported off coast of Japan \cite{nishimura2013genetic,nishimura2014morphology}. \emph{G. scabrosus} was described by Nishimura et al in 2014, however the toxicity data in table xx is from their publication in the previous year where the isolate was designated \emph{Gambierdiscus} sp. type 1 \cite{nishimura2013genetic,nishimura2014morphology}. \\
Furthermore, \emph{Gambierdiscus} of undetermined species found in Philippines \cite{gillespie1987possible}, Hong kong \cite{lu2004harmful}, Indonesia \cite{praseno1996hab}, Mauritius \cite{hurbungs2002seasonal}, the Mexican Pacific coast \cite{ceballos2006analisis} and regions around Madagascar \cite{grzebyk1994ecology}. Hernandez et al report that CFP is very common in Mexican-Caribbean, but that this not reflected in literature \cite{hernandez2004species}.\\
A report of CFP outbreak in 1994 in Madagascar is unusual as it reports a 20\% mortality rate from a sample size of 500 people. However the facilities to confirm CTX presence were not present \cite{habermehl1994severe}.

\subsection{Atlantic Ocean region}
An early \emph{Gambierdiscus} look alike was recorded in 1948 at Cape Verde Islands \cite{silva1956contribution} and 1979 Key Largos Florida \cite{taylor1979description}.
\emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. been described from east coast of USA, Carribean and Mediterranean as per table xx. The latter for the first time in 2003 near Crete in the Mediterranean Sea as an alien species emigrating to a new habitat, which could herald an emerging region for CFP \cite{aligizaki2008morphological,zenetos2009aquatic}.
Undefined \emph{Gambierdiscus} species have been more frequently reported at Cyprus, Rhodes and Saronikos Gulf \cite{aligizaki2009toxic,aligizaki2010diversity}, French West Indies \cite{lobel1988assessment}, Cuba \cite{delgado2006epiphytic} and Veracruz \cite{okolodkov2007seasonal}.
In Central and South America non specified species have been recorded in Costa Rica and Brazil (M. Montero pers. comm. in \cite{parsons2012gambierdiscus}).
Recent reports of CFP have emerged from Africa, specifically in Angola \cite{berdalet2012global}, the Canary Islands \cite{boada2010ciguatera} and Cameroon \cite{bienfang2008ciguatera} indicating expansion of \emph{Gambierdiscus} habitat or migratory vector species. %Aligizaki 08 harmful algae news alledgedly found gam in cannary islands? need to find the damn paper to check!

% and MTX been checked for??
The name of CFP is derived from the word "cigua", a native Cuban description of a turban shelled snail which was implicated in an outbreak of sickness in Spanish explorers in 1500s \cite{gudger1930poisonous}. Later the presence of CTX was confirmed the in turban snail \emph{Turbo argyrstoma} \cite{yasumoto1976toxicity}, however the majority of cases reported occur from large reef fish \cite{hokama2001ciguatera,lewis2001changing,dechraoui2005use,laurent2005ciguatera}. The recent consumption of large reef fish is one of the major factors in diagnostics of CFP due to rare retention of fish sample for testing.
The inconsistency of diagnostics contributes to the estimated report rate of CFP at less than 20\% globally \cite{dickey2010ciguatera}. Contributing factors to common misdiagnosis for CFP likely include the excess of 175 gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular symptoms \cite{sims1987theoretical}; potential variance of symptoms with portion size \cite{wong2008features,mak2013pacific}; different symptomatology between individuals with the same exposure source and exacerbation of manifestation with repeat exposure \cite{bagnis1979clinical,glaziou1993study}; and that it could be associated with other illnesses such as decompression sickness \cite{adams1993outbreak}, chronic fatigue syndrome, multiple sclerosis \cite{lindsay1997chronic,ting2001ciguatera} and brain tumours \cite{lindsay1997chronic}.
The under reporting and diagnostic issues mentioned, compounded by absence of an adequate commercial test kit \cite{wong2005study}, the exact figure for number of global CFP cases cannot be determined. Carnivorous fish are main cause of CFP, however herbivorous fish (eg. surgeonfish, parrotfish) pose important intermediate vector in the food chain \cite{cruz2006macroalgal,randall1958review,mak2013pacific}.%insert biomagnification here? % reference bollocksing the 2nd commercial test kits
Table xx shows a summary of fish species and other marine fauna which have tested positive for CTX from ciguatera prone regions and following reported outbreaks, though several hundred unverified fish species implicated in CFP \cite{}. %need ref from gurjeet FAO 2004
Most of the entries stem from mid-latitude tropical and sub-tropical zones, fitting with \emph{Gambierdiscus} distribution in Table xx. Table xx lists CTX detection only, as it is currently not common practice to test for MTXs in suspected ciguateric specimens. 
Studies predominantly focus on large reef fish, but toxin accumulation has been detected in eels, sea cucumbers, starfish, seals, jelly fish, lobster and octopus as per table xx. 
Sharks have been suspected after CFP outbreak but no remnant samples left available for testing \cite{boisier1995fatal,lehane2000ciguatera,habermehl1994severe}. In the case of a Madagascan outbreak in 1994, the mortality rate from implicated shark consumption was 20\% \cite{habermehl1994severe}. 
Studies pertaining to the toxicity of \emph{Gambierdicus} towards copepods and their nauplii were conducted \cite{lee2014toxicity}, as copepds feed on microalgae attached to macroalgae. They could constitute the primary consumers in the food chain, which can lead to toxin accumulation \cite{raisuddin2007copepod} and constitute as the first component of the ciguateric food web. The impact of \emph{G. yasumotoi} on the model copepod \emph{Tigriopus japonicus} was assessed in a study conducted by Lee et al, finding that the presence of \emph{G. yasumotoi} cells, or to a lesser extent growth media stock, cause immobility and mortality on adult copepods, where an the concentration of \emph{G. yasumotoi} present correlated with effect. Furthermore nauplii had a lower threshold concentrations \cite{lee2014toxicity}.
It has been shown that ciguatera toxins passing through the food chain in the Pacific undergo biotransformation. %different types between different trophic levels
Some modifications can increase the potency of the toxins up to 10-fold, compared to the toxin produced by \textit{G.toxicus} \cite{lewis2006ciguatera}.
In 2005 Hung et al established that the CFP of three family members was caused by CTX present in baracuda fish eggs \cite{hung2005persistent}. This indicates that bioaccumulated CTXs can be passed on to offspring which start their life cycle with CTX concentrations above the toxicity threshold to elicit CFP. %contrats with study describing loss of CTXs over time
On small island nations, native fisherman know ciguatera prone zones and fish species to avoid so the local community relies on garnered knowledge. However in French Polynesia, CTXs were detected in fish considered to be safe \cite{darius2007ciguatera}.
The development of reliable, inexpensive and laymen operable detection method for ciguateric food sources has been a decades long quest. Initially a stick enzyme immunoassay (SEIA) \cite{hokama1985rapid} was developed, followed by a solid phase immunoassay (SPIA) \cite{hokama1990simplified}.These methods progressed to the development of commercial kits (i.e. Cigua-check\textregistered \ and Ciguatect\textregistered), although these have yielded a considerable amount of false positives and false negatives \cite{wong2005study}. Cigua-check\textregistered is no longer manufactured.%what about ciguatext? wong 05 is ciguacheck only
A host of bioassays have also been developed, though these are problematic due to toxin specificity and quantification, inefficiencies, ethical considerations \cite{dickey2010ciguatera}.
Bioassays for ciguateric fish detection have used chickens \cite{}, cats \cite{larson1967ciguatera}, mongooses \cite{hokama1977radioimmunoassay}, diptera larvae \cite{labrousse1996toxicological}, brine shrimp \cite{granade1976ciguatera} and mosquitoes \cite{bagnis1987use}.
Many alternative biochemical assays have been proposed to replace bioassays for sea food testing. Radioimmunoassay \cite{hokama1977radioimmunoassay} preceeded the financially more viable, higher throughput enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) \cite{hokama1983rapid}, which has been refined to reliably detect picogram concentration of CTX in fish tissue \cite{campora2008detection,campora2010evaluating}. Currently, the most commonly used detection method is MBA via intraperitoneal injection, as per table xx, even though it does not provide linear dose-response relationship with CTX toxicity \cite{hoffman1983mouse}. 
To reliably elucidate toxin profiles and structures in samples, it is imperative to employ chromatographic techniques such as HPCL, UPLC and LC-MS with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) \cite{legrand1989isolation,murata1990structures,murata1990structures,satake1996isolation,diogened2014chemistry} and radio ligand binding (RLB) \cite{hamilton2002multiple,hamilton2002isolation}. These methods are effective and informative, however their limitation lies in expense and requirement of special training hence they are not routine in the field and unlikely to become so. %reference?
Confirmation of CTX or MTX congener(s) present is conducted by UPLC/HPLC then LC-MS, where the toxin is first isolated and the fractionated to compare against their known molecular weights (tables x and xx). For expedient field application, a rapid analysis method was proposed \cite{lewis2009rapid}, however acquisition of standards difficult due to limited natural CTX compounds \cite{berdalet2012global} and though synthetic production is possible, it is highly complex \cite{hirama2001total}. Lacking consistent source for reference, reliable quantification of CTX and congeners is not possible. A compounding problem is the co-elution peaks of similar compounds and development of inhibiting/promoting matrixes to address this problem remain unsuccessful.
Alternate screening options are sodium channel binding (N2A) \cite{dickey2010ciguatera} and RBA \cite{poli1997identification,darius2007ciguatera} which are both recommended by European Food Standard Association \cite{}. %ummm... check this shit out
However, these assays have the same drawback of not discerning between CTX and MTX congeners, so a positive result would need validation via LC-MS analysis \cite{diogened2014chemistry}.

\section{Trophic transfer of toxins in feeding trials}
Kohli 14 and Ledreux 14
----> unidentified metabolites produced by \emph{Gambierdiscus} in fish samples \cite{endean1993variation,vernoux1997isolation}.
During a feeding study Kohli et al. detected the presence of \emph{G. australes} in the viscera of snapper via nested PCR. This could provide an effective, inexpensive and widely established method to detect whether suspected ciguateric fish have consumed \emph{Gambierdiscus}, and furthermore this approach can be species specific giving an indication to the possible toxin profile present in the fish \cite{kohli2014feeding}.
 %ref in table 2 AND changed with Mak
CFP also reported in no-endemic areas due to increased seafood import \cite{glaziou1994epidemiology,ting2001ciguatera}.Urgent requirement to fill deficit of knowledge regarding species other than fish as coastal toxin vectors. 
Our understanding of the trophic components of ciguateric food webs are still expanding.

\section{Conclusion}
\emph{Gambierduiscus} is a genus of BHABs that are responsible for CFP. With the increase in frequency of CFP cases globally, as well as recorded blooms, it is essential to complement our currently fragmentory understanding. Aspects include elucidating the species specific toxin profiles with LC-MS, sampling and phylogeny using genetic markers.sampling widespread at different depth 
knowledge gap: do MTX bioaccumulate up the food chain? and role in CFP?
