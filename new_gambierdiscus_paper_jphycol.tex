\section{Abstract}
\textit{Gambierdiscus} is a genus of benthic dinoflagellates which is found worldwide. 
Some species produce neurotoxins (maitotoxins and ciguatoxins) which  bioaccumulate and cause ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP), a potentially fatal food-borne illness that is common worldwide in tropical regions. 
The investigation of toxigenic species of \textit{Gambierdiscus} in CFP endemic regions in Australia is necessary as a first step to determine which species of Gambierdiscus are related to CFP cases occurring in this region.
In this study we characterised five strains of \textit{Gambierdiscus} collected from Heron Island,  Australia, a region in which ciguatera is endemic. Clonal cultures were processed using (i) light microscopy; (ii) scanning electron microscopy; (iii) DNA sequencing based on the nuclear encoded ribosomal  18S and D8-D10 28S regions; (iv) toxicity via mouse bioassay and; (v) toxin profile as determined by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. 
Both the morphological and phylogenetic data indicated that these strains represent a new, toxic species of \emph{Gambierdiscus}, \emph{Gambierdiscus lapillus} sp. nov (plate formula Po, 3', 0a, 7'', 6c, 7-8s, 5''', 0p, 2'''' and distinctive by size and hatchet shaped 2' plate). Culture extracts were found to be toxic using the mouse bioassay. Using chemical analysis, it was determined that they did not contain maitotoxin (MTX1) or known algal-derived ciguatoxin analogs (CTX3B, 3C, CTX4A, 4B), but that they contained putative MTX3, and likely other unknown compounds.

\section{Introduction}

%\subsection{overview, history, diff sp}
\emph{Gambierdiscus} Adachi et Fukuyo is a genus of benthic dinoflagellate genus, epiphytic on many substrates in shallow tropical and sub-tropical waters \citep{marine2014}. 
Species of \emph{Gambierdiscus} have been found to produce the ciguatoxins (CTX), which are potent neurotoxins thought to be responsible for ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) \citep{berdalet2012global}. 
Since the discovery of the type species \emph{G. toxicus} R.Adachi \& Y.Fukuyo in 1977 \citep{yasumoto1977finding}, extensive research has established that certain species of the genus are the primary sources of CTXs, the causative agent of CFP \citep{chinain1997intraspecific,holmes1998gambierdiscus}. 
Maitotoxins (MTXs) are also commonly produced, however their role in CFP is yet to be established \citep{kohli2014feeding}. 

For over 15 years, \emph{Gambierdiscus} was considered to be a monotypic taxon, but since 1995 new species have been discovered with more extensive sampling in the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean and Pacific \citep{faust1995observation,holmes1998gambierdiscus,litaker2009taxonomy,chinain1999morphology,fraga2011gambierdiscus,nishimura2014morphology}.
Currently 11 species, and six unnamed clades of \emph{Gambierdiscus} have been described based on their distinct morphological and genetic characteristics \citep{adachi1979thecal,faust1995observation,chinain1999morphology,litaker2009taxonomy,nishimura2014morphology,fraga2011gambierdiscus}.  
The genus \emph{Fukuyoa} F. G\'omez, D. Qiu, R.M. Lopes \& S. Lin was separated from \emph{Gambierdiscus} in 2015 \citep{gomez2015fukuyoa}. \emph{Fukuyoa} spp. produce MTX \citep{holmes1998gambierdiscus,holland2013differences} and hence may contribute to CFP \citep{kohli2014feeding}, they will be referred to alongside \emph{Gambierdiscus} where appropriate.
Ascertaining the distribution of species and their toxin production is essential for assessing risk of CFP to local populations as well as the seafood industry.

%\subsection{toxins and CFP}
CFP is the most common non bacterial illness associated with seafood consumption \citep{friedman2008ciguatera}, however the correct diagnosis of the illness is difficult due to extensive list of neurological, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular symptoms \citep{sims1987theoretical}. 
The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization's international panel for harmful algal blooms has proposed a coordinated global ciguatera strategy to address the impact of the disease through \emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. detection and monitoring, improved toxin detection in seafood and epidemiological data collation \citep{globalcig}.
The suite of toxins, if any, produced by \emph{Gambierdiscus} varies between species. 
Bioassays are commonly used to assess toxicity, however liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis is required to unambiguously identify the toxins present \citep{diogened2014chemistry}. 
Some species exclusively produce MTX (\emph{G. australes} \citep{rhodes2014production}) while others solely produce CTX (\emph{G. polynesiensis} \citep{rhodes2014production}) or neither (\emph{G. carpenteri} \citep{kohli2014high}), as confirmed by LC-MS/MS. 

%\subsection{abundance and distribution}
Some \emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. have been classified as endemic to either the Pacific or Atlantic Oceans, while others have been found globally distributed \citep{berdalet2012global,litaker2010global}. %It has been suggested that with more extensive sampling, the distribution is likely to be global for all \emph{Gambierdiscus} species \citep{testerICHA}. 
However, the current understanding about \emph{Gambierdiscus} distribution and abundance is fragmentary due to the paucity of studies worldwide, the continued discovery of new species, difficulty with species identification with light microscopy and the comparatively lower sampling frequency in the Atlantic Ocean \citep{berdalet2012global,nishimura2014morphology}. 

Different species of \emph{Gambierdiscus} usually co-occur at sample sites \citep{litaker2010global}. 
As species can show intra-specific morphological variability \citep{bravo2014cellular}, but can also be highly morphologically similar to one another \citep{kohli2014high}, molecular genetics techniques are necessary to complement the analysis of morphology for species determination. 
The taxonomy of the genus was poorly defined until relatively recently (ie \citep{litaker2009taxonomy,richlen2008phylogeography}) which means that species from studies pre-dating 2009 are difficult to evaluate based on current species delimitations \citep{berdalet2012global}. %Morphology alongside genetic tools can identify species with a high certainty.

%Annual reported CFP cases are estimated up to 500,000 globally and are responsible for 80 to 96 \% of human poisoning from consuming seafood \citep{fleming1998seafood,grandjean2008centers}. ---> check ref
 %As CFP is increasing in frequency in the Pacific \citep{skinner2011ciguatera} and in other regions, an understanding of the distribution and species specific toxicology of \emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. is essential \citep{globalcig}.
 
%\subsection{australia}
Cases of CFP have been reported in Australia, mostly around the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), but a consistent CTX-producing species of \emph{Gambierdiscus} has not yet been confirmed \citep{lewis2006ciguatera}. 
This is likely due to a combination of factors:
Australia has a coastline of ~66,000 km (Fig. ~\ref{fig:OzSites}), of which at least 50\% could be considered tropical or sub-tropical, most of which has never been sampled for \textit{Gambierdiscus} species presence; species identifications have often been uncertain; culturing \textit{Gambierdiscus} requires considerable time and effort; and measuring CTX analogs is also very difficult. 
To date,  the four species \emph{G. belizeanus} M.A.Faust, \emph{G. carpenteri} Kibler, Litaker, Faust, Holland, Vandersea \& Tester, \emph{G. toxicus} and \emph{F. yasumotoi} (M.J.Holmes) F.G\'omez, D.X.Qiu, R.M.Lopes \& Senjie Lin have been identified in Australia (Table ~\ref{tbl:OzTable}), in Queensland and New South Wales. 
\emph{Gambierdiscus} was also detected as part of a benthic dinoflagellate community via pyrosequencing in Western Australia, however could only be identified to genus level \citep{kohli2014cob}.
Three analogues of MTX, designated MTX-1, MTX-2 and MTX-3, isolated from a \emph{Gambierdiscus} sp. in Queensland, Australia \citep{holmes1994purification}. 
As this discovery pre-dates the understanding that \emph{Gambierdiscus} includes more species than \emph{G. toxicus}, it remains unclear from which species these analogues were isolated.  
It is highly likely that many more \emph{Gambierdiscus} species were present even at those particular sites examined, as in each case the studies represent only single or short term sampling events at one location within a site. 
Therefore the toxicity and distribution of \emph{Gambierdiscus} species in Australian coastal waters remains largely unknown. %Consequently, the causative agent for CFP in Australia has not yet been determined. \\

The aim of the current study was to further the continued search for the causative agent/s of CFP in Australia by characterizing a species of \emph{Gambierdiscus} from a ciguateric region using molecular and morphological methods, and investigate the toxicology of the isolates.

\section{Materials and methods}

\subsection{Specimen collection and culture conditions}
\FloatBarrier
Specimens were collected from Heron Island (23$^{\circ}$ 4420' S, 151$^{\circ}$ 9140' E), which is part of the southern GBR region. 
Heron Island constitutes site 3 of previous specimen collection in Australia (Fig. ~\ref{fig:OzSites}).
In October 2013, a sample of \emph{Halimeda} sp. was taken when the average sea surface temperature was 23.8 $^{\circ}$C. 
A second sample of \emph{Padina} sp. was collected in July 2014 at a time when the average sea surface temperature was 19.8 $^{\circ}$C.
Macroalgal samples were taken around the Heron Island research station (Fig. ~\ref{fig:OzSites}). 
The macroalgal samples were stored in 500ml bottles with seawater and processed within 48 hours. 
The samples were shaken to dislodge protists, then concentrated through a 125 $\mu$m sieve \citep{litaker2010global}. 
Single cells were isolated from the samples using a micropipette under an inverted light microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ni), washed three times in sterile seawater, and transferred into F/10 medium \citep{holmes1991strain} to establish clonal cultures.
The culture HG1 was isolated from the sample from October 2013, while the cultures HG4, HG5, HG6, HG7, HG26 were isolated from the sample from July 2014.
The cultures were maintained F/10 medium at 27 $^{\circ}$C, 60$\mu$mol.m$^{2}$.s$^{-1}$ light in 12hr:12hr light to dark cycles.

\subsection{Morphological analyses}
The cultures HG4, HG6, HG7 and HG26 (during exponential growth phase) were fixed with 10 \% Lugol's iodide and examined with an inverted light microscope (Nikon Eclipse TS100 equipped with an Infinite Luminera 1 camera) for cell size. 
Depth (D: measured along dorso-ventral axis) and width (W: measured between the lateral axis) was measured for 30 to 36 cells per strain.
The culture HG26 was fixed with 10 \% Lugol's iodide for plastid and nucleus diagnosis with an inverted light microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ni equipped with an Nikon DS-Qi2 camera).
For plate pattern identification LM with calcofluor staining of the type strain HG7 was carried out under UV (Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with Olympus DP73 camera, Australia). 
The culture was centrifuged at 300g, concentrated and fixed in 4\% Lugol’s iodide, then stained with 1 $\mu$L of calcofluor stock solution (1 mg.mL$^{-1}$) of Fluorescent Brightener 28 (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) for illumination.
For HG4, HG5, HG6, HG7 and HG26 30 ml of culture was centrifuged at 15,000 x g and concentrated to 2 ml, preserved with 10 \% Lugol's iodide, and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at the Senckenberg am Meer (Wilhelmshaven, Germany). 
Cells were placed on a 5 $\mu$m Millipore filter, rinsed in distilled water, and dehydrated in a series of increasing ethanol concentrations (30, 50, 70, 85, 90, 100 \%), followed by chemical drying with hexamethyldisilazane at room temperature. 
When completely dry, the sample was mounted on a stub and sputter coated with gold palladium (SCD 050 Bal-Tec, BAL-TEC Pr\"aparations-ger\" atevertrieb, Wallof, Germany). 
Cells were observed using a Tescan VEGA3 microscope (Elekronen-Optik-Service GmbH, Dortmund, Germany) at 15 kV.

\subsection{Genomic DNA extraction}
Genomic DNA was extracted using the CTAB method \citep{zhou1999analysis}. 
Purity and concentration of the extract was measured by Nanodrop (Nanodrop2000, Thermo Scientific), the integrity was visualised on 1\% agarose gel.

\subsection{PCR amplification and sequencing}
\FloatBarrier
Extracted DNA was used as a template to amplify rDNA sequences in 25 $\mu$l mixture in PCR tubes. 
Reactions consisted of a final concentration of 0.6 $\mu$M forward and reverse primer, 0.4 $\mu$M BSA, 2 - 20 ng DNA, 12.5 $\mu$l 2xEconoTaq (Lucigen Corporation, Middleton, WI, USA) and 7.5 $\mu$l PCR grade water.\\
The PCR cycling comprised of an initial 10 min step at 94 $^{\circ}$C, followed by 30 cycles of denaturing at 94 $^{\circ}$C for 30 s, annealing at 55 $^{\circ}$C for 30 s and extension at 72 $^{\circ}$C for 1 min, finalized with 3 minutes of extension at 72 $^{\circ}$C.
The LSU D8-D10 and SSU rDNA regions were amplified with the FD8-RB and 18ScomF1-18ScomR1 primer sets, respectively (Table ~\ref{tbl:PrimerTable}).\\
Sanger sequencing was conducted by Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, Korea).

\subsection{Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis}
Sequencing data were aligned with \emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. data from the GenBank reference database (accession numbers as part of Fig. ~\ref{fig:HGD8D10} and Fig. ~\ref{fig:HGSSU}). 
The alignment algorithm MUSCLE, with a maximum of eight iterations \citep{edgar2004muscle}, was used through the Geneious software, version 8.1.7 \citep{kearse2012geneious}. 
Alignments were truncated to the same length (D10-D8 and SSU at 799bp and 1690bp, respectively), and discrepancies removed. 
Alignments are available on request.
Phylogenetic trees were calculated with Bayesian inference (BI) as well as maximum likelihood (ML). 
BI, via Mr. Bayes 3.2.2, was used to estimate the posterior probability (PP) distribution with Metropolis-Coupled Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations \citep{ronquist2003mrbayes}. 
A random staring tree with three heated and one cold chain(s) with a temperature set at 0.2. Trees were sampled every 100th generation for the 2,000,000 generations generated.
PHYML was used for ML analysis with 1,000 bootstraps (BS) \citep{guindon2003simple}.
The general time reversal model with an estimated gamma distribution was used for both analyses.\\

\subsection{Toxin production}

\subsubsection{Toxicity via mouse bioassay}
The cultures HG4, HG6 and HG7 (1,248,000, 3,982,000, and 1,323,200 cells, respectively) were freeze-dried in late stationary phase (day 36 of culture). 
The weights of the samples were 57.0 mg, 155.0 mg and 23.0 mg, respectively. 
The samples were extracted exhaustively with methanol. 
The extracts were evaporated to a small volume at 35$^{\circ}$C using a rotary evaporator, and the solution aliquotted into glass vials. 
The remaining methanol was removed under a stream of nitrogen, and the extracts freeze-dried overnight. 
The total weight of the extracts, which were all brown green colour, was as follows: HG4, 22.5 mg HG6, 42.9 mg HG7, 15.1 mg. 
The median lethal doses of the test materials by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection were determined according to the principles of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Guideline 425. 
Samples were dissolved in 1\% Tween 60 in normal saline immediately before dosing. 
For toxicity by i.p. injection, aliquots of this solution, made up to a total volume of 1 ml with the same solvent, were injected into female Swiss mice, of initial body weight 18-22 g. 
The toxicity of the extract of HG6 by gavage was also investigated, when aliquots of the extract solution were made up to 200 $\mu$l with Tween-saline. 
The mice were monitored intensively during the day of dosing. 
Survivors were examined and weighed each day for the following 13 d, after which they were killed and necropsied. 
Tap water and food (Rat and Mouse Cubes, Speciality Feeds Ltd, Glen Forrest, Western Australia) were available at all times.\\

\subsubsection{Toxin profile screening by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry}
After 36 days in culture 2 litres of HG4, HG6 and HG7 were centrifuged (15,000g) and the resultant pellet freeze-dried. 
Pellets were extracted with methanol and screened for the presence of maitotoxin (MTX-1) and algal CTXs (CTX-3B, CTX-3C, CTX-4A, CTX-4B) using a LC-MS/MS methods developed by the Cawthron Institute \citep{kohli2014feeding}.
The limit of detection of the analysis was ~1 ng.mL$^{-1}$ for MTX-1 and <1 ng.mL$^{-1}$ for the various CTX analogs monitored.

Description: Cells were anterioposteriorly compressed and round to ellipsoid, sometimes dorsally pointed in apical view (Figs. ~\ref{fig:PetLM}, ~\ref{fig:epiSEM}). 
Cells were small compared to other \textit{Gambierdiscus} spp., with a dorsoventral depth of 40.6 $\mu$m (range of 34.4 - 50.9 $\mu$m; SD 3.3 $\mu$m) and width of 39 $\mu$m (range of 32 - 46.9 $\mu$m; SD 3.2 $\mu$m) with a depth to width ratio of 1.04 (SD 0.06 $\mu$m) (n=128, Table ~\ref{tbl:SizeTable}).

\FloatBarrier
The hypotheca was slightly higher than the epitheca, rarely significantly higher (Fig. ~\ref{fig:hypoSEM}f and Fig. S1a).
The cell surface had a strong  reticulate-foveate ornamentation (Figs. ~\ref{fig:PetLM}, ~\ref{fig:epiSEM}, ~\ref{fig:hypoSEM}), apical and antapical plates with more regularly arranged deep depressions nearly all containing a pore, and pre- and postcingular plates more irregularly reticulated with scattered pores (Fig. ~\ref{fig:ornSEM}). 
Wide intercalary bands had a ribbed appearance (Fig. ~\ref{fig:ornSEM}). 
Newly developing plates after cell division had a smooth surface with scattered pores (Fig. ~\ref{fig:ornSEM}d). 
The plate formula (Kofoid tabulation) was Po, 3', 0a, 7'', 6c, 7-8s, 5''', 0p, 2'''' (Figs. ~\ref{fig:epiSEM}, ~\ref{fig:hypoSEM}, S1, S2).
The apical pore plate (Po) is oval with a fish-hook shaped, slit-like apical pore, located close to the center of the epitheca, slightly shifted ventrally (Fig.~\ref{fig:epiSEM}). 
Po was about ~6.1-5.2 x 3.6-3.7 $\mu$m in size (Fig. ~\ref{fig:epiSEM}e-h). 
twenty-eight to thirty-four large depressions were distributed over the Po plate and arranged in no constant pattern (Fig. ~\ref{fig:epiSEM}e-g); one (Fig. ~\ref{fig:epiSEM}e) or two (Fig. ~\ref{fig:epiSEM}f, g) rows of depressions intruded into the hook. 
As seen by an inside view the depressions contained a pore (Fig.~\ref{fig:epiSEM}h). 
Also a tiny pore was visible on the Po-plate (Fig. ~\ref{fig:latSEM}c). 
The largest apical plate was the hatchet-shaped 2' plate, followed by the pentagonal 3' plate and the hexagonal 1' plate (Fig. ~\ref{fig:PetLM}c, ~\ref{fig:epiSEM}a-d, ~\ref{fig:DrawMorph}a).  
The largest precingular plate was plate 3'' (four-sided, covering the left lateral precingular area) and the pentagonal 4'' plate (dorsal) was nearly of the same size (Figs. ~\ref{fig:epiSEM}a-d, ~\ref{fig:DrawMorph}a).  
Plates 5'' and 6'' were on the right lateral side (Figs.~\ref{fig:epiSEM}a, \ref{fig:DrawMorph}a).  
Plates 1'' and 7'' were the smallest (Fig. ~\ref{fig:epiSEM}b, ~\ref{fig:hypoSEM}c, ~\ref{fig:DrawMorph}a) located ventrally.  
The largest postcingular plate was the 4''' plate (covering most of the left hypotheca), followed by the plates 2''', 3''', 5''' and 1''' (Figs ~\ref{fig:hypoSEM}a-b, ~\ref{fig:DrawMorph}b). 
The quadrangular first antapical plate (1'''') was small and the larger, relatively narrow pentagonal 2'''' plate that covered the antapex (Fig. ~\ref{fig:hypoSEM}a-b, ~\ref{fig:DrawMorph}b). 
The sulcus was a deep excavation (Fig. ~\ref{fig:hypoSEM}c, g) and composed of seven to eight plates (Fig. S2). 
The narrow and deep cingulum was difficult to observe and consisted of six plates (Fig. S2c). 
A few cells displayed shape variability of plate 2' (Fig. S3c-e). 
The shape varied from hatchet shaped (main morphology) to nearly rectangular (Fig. S3c) and six-sided (Fig. S3e).  
Some of the cells were tear-drop shaped rather than ellipsoid (Fig. S3a-c).

\subsubsection{Phylogenetics}
\FloatBarrier 
Phylogenetic trees for SSU and D8-D10 LSU rDNA regions were inferred using both BI and ML methods. 
Strains were marked according to their geographic origin, as per figure description (Figs. ~\ref{fig:HGD8D10}, ~\ref{fig:HGSSU}). 
Branches were analyzed thus: 100\%/1.0 was fully supported, above 90\%/0.9 was very well supported, above 80\%/0.8 was relatively well supported and below 50\%/0.5 was unsupported for ML and BI, respectively.
The SSU rDNA  topologies using BI and ML were the same with all major branches fully supported ( 1.00 / 100, PP and BS, respectively). 
Within \emph{Gambierdiscus}, the majority of the branches were fully supported, with all except one at least relatively well supported. 
The branch splitting \emph{G. australes} M.Chinian \& M.A.Faust from the major clade including \emph{G. pacificus} M.Chinain \&
M.Faust, \emph{G. toxicus} and \emph{G. lapillus} had the lowest support at 0.95 / 60.
For the SSU rDNA region, the major clades of \textit{Gambierdiscus} were fully supported based on ML BS and BI PP. 
The major clade support for the D8D10 LSU rDNA varied from fully supported to unsupported depending on the clade and support between ML BS and BI PP varied (eg. the branching for the major clade containing \emph{G. caribaeus} Vandersea, Litaker, Faust, Kibler, Holland \& Tester and \emph{G. carpenteri} Kibler, Litaker, Faust, Holland, Vandersea \& Tester). 
The same relationships of the Heron Island isolates HG1, HG4, HG6, HG7 and HG26 to the previously described \emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. as well as uncharacterised ribotypes and species types were found in the phylogenies based on both D8D10 LSU rDNA (Fig. ~\ref{fig:HGD8D10}) and SSU rDNA (Fig. ~\ref{fig:HGSSU}). 
The phylogenies showed that these strains are clearly separated from other \emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. and fall into a new, fully supported clade. 
The new clade falls within the most diverse major clade (8 species, Fig. ~\ref{fig:HGD8D10}). 
\emph{Gambierdiscus lapillus} is closely related to \emph{G.} sp. type 6, \emph{G. toxicus} and \emph{G. pacificus}. 
The closest following relatives from within their major clade are \emph{G.} sp. type 5, \emph{G. scabrosus}, \emph{G.} ribotype 2 and then \emph{G. belizeanus} in descending order. \\
No differentiation within species based on their geographic origin was determined for the SSU rDNA or LSU D8-D10 rDNA regions (Fig. ~\ref{fig:HGD8D10} and Fig. ~\ref{fig:HGSSU}).
%emph{G. silvae} was also isolated alongside HG4, HG6 , HG7 and HG26.

\subsubsection{Toxicology}

\paragraph{Toxicity via intraperitoneal injection.}
The i.p. LD50 of the extract of HG6 was 0.78 mg.kg$^{-1}$, or 1,448 cells.per MU, with 95\% confidence limits between 0.40 and 1.60 mg.kg$^{-1}$. 
At high dose-levels, stretching movements were observed immediately after injection of the test material, most likely due to irritation. 
This was rapidly followed by cessation of movement and abdominal breathing. 
Respiration rates declined and death occurred within 1.5-4 hours after dosing. 
At necropsy, erythema was observed throughout the gastrointestinal tract of these animals. 
At lower doses, death occurred at up to 24 hours after dosing. 
The stomachs of these animals were grossly distended with gas and with abnormally fluid contents. 
An abnormally large amount of material was present in the duodenum and upper jejunum, which was reddish-brown in colour and gelatinous in consistency. Caeca were also enlarged. 
Erythema in the glandular stomach was noted. No gross changes were observed in any other organ. 
The acute i.p. toxicity of the extract of HG7 was lower than that of HG6, with an LD50 of 12.5 mg.kg$^{-1}$, or 219,073 cells.per MU, with 95\% confidence interval between 10.1 and 15.3 mg.kg$^{-1}$. 
The symptoms of intoxication and the gross pathology in mice injected with HG7 were the same as those recorded with HG6. 
The acute i.p. toxicity of the extract of HG4 was even lower. 
No deaths were recorded at 100 mg.kg$^{-1}$. 
A dose of 150 mg/kg was lethal, however, with the same effects as seen with the other two extracts. 
Insufficient material was available to determine a precise LD50, though from the available data it may be concluded that it lies between 100 and 150 mg.kg$^{-1}$, or between 1,109,333 cells.per MU
and 1,664,000 cells.per MU.

\paragraph{Toxicity via gavage.}
 HG6 was much less toxic by oral administration than by i.p. injection. 
 No effects were observed at a dose of 300 mg.kg$^{-1}$, which is 385 times the median lethal dose by i.p. injection. 
 Insufficient material was available for dosing at higher levels.​

\paragraph{Toxin profile.}
Analysis of extracts from \textit{G. lapillu}s isolates showed no detectable MTX-1 or known algal CTXs, CTX3B, 3C, 4A, 4B. 
However, all extracts were positive for a compound tentatively described as MTX-3, which represent a sulfated polyether produced by many \textit{Gambierdiscus} species. 
Also, unassigned chromatographic peaks were observed in the CTX transition and these warrant further investigation.

\section{Discussion}
\emph{Gambierdiscus lapillus} cells are anterio-posteriorly compressed, poses a narrow 2'''' plate (1p plate equivalent) and heavily areolated cell surface (strong reticulate-foveate thecal ornamentation), as does \emph{G. belizeanus}  \citep{litaker2009taxonomy}.
 \emph{Gambierdiscus scabrosus} T.Nishimura, Shinya Sato \& M.Adachi is also morphologically similar to \emph{G. belizeanus}, but can be distinguished by the asymmetry of the 4'' plate (designated 3'' by Nishimura et al. (2014)) compared to the symmetry of the 4'' plate in \emph{G. belizeanus} (Table 4, asymmetric in Fig. 42A in \citep{hoppenrath2014marine}). 
 Hence, the closest morphological relatives to \emph{G. lapillus} are \emph{G. belizeanus} and \emph{G. scabrosus}. 
Comparing the distinguishing morphological characteristics between \emph{G. lapillus} sister species is the \textit{G. lapillus}'s diminutive size (Figs. ~\ref{fig:DrawMorph}, ~\ref{fig:SizeGraph}).

\end{figure} 

 Size is a feature that has been previously used to distinguish species of \emph{Gambierdiscus} from each other \citep{litaker2009taxonomy}. 
\emph{Gambierdiscus lapillus} also differs to \emph{G. scabrosus} due to it's symmetric 4'' plate (Fig. ~\ref{fig:epiSEM}a), hence it is closer morphologically to \emph{G. belizeanus}. 
The morphological point of difference between the two species lies in the 2' plate (Fig. ~\ref{fig:DrawMorph}).  
The 2' plate of \emph{G. lapillus} is hatchet shaped (Fig. ~\ref{fig:epiSEM}a-d) whereas the 2' plate of \emph{G. belizeanus} is rectangular (Fig. 3 in \citep{faust1995observation}). 
In terms of the genetic relatedness of the new species and \textit{G. belizeanus}, they are relatively distantly related (Fig. ~\ref{fig:HGD8D10} and Fig. ~\ref{fig:HGSSU}). \\
A small subset of isolates displayed some variability morphological features, and were different to the majority of cells, in the 2' plate as well as cell shape (Fig. S3).  
Bravo et al. (2014) recorded a change in cell shape and size during the life cycle of a clonal strain of \emph{Gambierdiscus} sp., where a small proportion of the cells observed displayed this variability. 
They postulate that this was previously unrecorded due to their large number of observations compared to the rest of the literature \citep{bravo2014cellular}. 
We suggest that the variability we observed is similar due to screening numerous cells of four strains of \emph{G. lapillus}. 
The variability in 2' plate is negligible; the hatchet shape of this plate is still a diagnostic tool for identifying \textit{G. lapillus}.\\
Kohli et al. (2014a) observed a similar difference from the original species description in the morphology of strains of  \emph{G. carpenteri} \citep{kohli2014high}. 
Strains of \emph{G. carpenteri} isolated from southern NSW, Australia, were identified by a combination of morphological features and genetic sequencing. 
Genetically these strains were 99\% identical to the type strains of \textit{G. carpenteri}. 
However, their morphological features differed somewhat from those originally described for \textit{G. carpenteri}, and were more similar to those of the very similar species \emph{G. toxicus} (broad 2'''' plates, pointed dorsal ends, and the lack of a dorsal rostrum) \citep{kohli2014high,litaker2009taxonomy}.
The potential intraspecific morphological variability of \emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. indicates that the identification of \emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. needs to be approached with caution, and preferably verified with molecular analysis.\\
The sister groups to \emph{G. lapillus} in the phylogenetic analyses were found to be \emph{G. pacificus} and \emph{G. toxicus}, 
which was fully supported (Fig. ~\ref{fig:HGD8D10} and Fig. ~\ref{fig:HGSSU}). 
For the D8-D10 LSU region, the confidence of the interspecies relationship within the major clade containing \emph{G. lapillus} was lower.  
While the resolution of \emph{G. lapillus} as a separate species is fully supported, the other branches within that major clade were more ambiguous and support differed between BI and ML with the latter consistently lower than the former. 
Branches were well supported or better in BI phylogeny, while in the ML phylogeny some were unsupported. 
The topology of the clade resembles that of the phylogeny by Xu et al. (2014), in which the \emph{G.} sp. type 5 and \emph{G.} sp. type 6 were presented, hence it can be assumed that the BI phylogeny is accurate\citep{xu2014distribution}.
The discrepancy in confidence between SSU and D8-D10 LSU could be due to the length of the fragment, as the SSU fragment is almost twice the length as the LSU fragment. 
Alternatively it could be due to lower selection pressure, in effect higher mutation rate, in the D8-D10 region compared to the SSU region. 
Murray et al. (2015) found that the D1-D6 LSU region in dinoflagellates had a substitution rate 4-8\% times that of the SSU region \citep{murray2005improving}. 
Whether this faster substitution rate applies to the D8-D10 region remains unknown, however the possibility should be taken into consideration. \\
Morphologically, \emph{G. lapillus} is distinct from \emph{G. pacificus} due to it's smooth cell surface \citep{chinain1999morphology}, whereas \emph{G. lapillus} is discrete from \emph{G. toxicus} based on the broad 2'''' plate of \emph{G. toxicus} \citep{litaker2009taxonomy}.\\

Berdalet et al. (2012) postulated that species of \textit{Gambierdiscus} may be cosmopolitan, and the fact that some species were reported from only one or few locations was likely due to under sampling \citep{litaker2010global}. 
It has been postulated that \textit{Gambierdiscus} strains of the same species  in warmer areas display higher toxicity than those in cooler regions \citep{bomber1989epiphytism}. 
To observe whether genetic divergence exists between strains from the same species from different localities, where possible a range of isolates from a variety of geographic locations were included in the phylogenetic study. 
The phylogenetic analysis of the D8-D10 LSU rDNA (Fig. ~\ref{fig:HGD8D10})  \emph{G. belizeanus}, \emph{G. caribaeus}, \emph{G. carpenteri},  \emph{G. carolinianus} Litaker, Vandersea, Faust, Kibler, Holland \& Tester and \emph{G. toxicus} strains of the same species clustered together, regardless of their geographic origin. 
Examining the strain distribution in light of their geographic origin for the SSU rDNA fragment (Fig. ~\ref{fig:HGSSU}), a similar trend was found. 
Strains of \emph{G. carpenteri}, \emph{G. caribaeus} and \emph{G. toxicus} showed closer relationship to geographically removed strains than ones from their own location.
This indicates that the rDNA fragments used in this study are likely not variable enough to reveal intraspecific, regional-level divergence. 
More investigation using tools such as microsatellites or RADseq are likely required to reveal regional differences.

CFP is endemic to the GBR in Australia, yet the particular species of \textit{Gambierdiscus} that are most likely producing CTXs in this region are still not known. 
The report that \textit{F. paulensis} from the Mediterranean produces possible analogs of CTXs \citep{laza2016characterization} is interesting, as the study classifies the \textit{F.} cf. \textit{yasumotoi} found in Australia as \textit{F. paulensis} (Table 1, \citep{murray2014molecular}). 
However, we suggest caution should be used in interpreting the LC-MS results on \textit{F. paulensis} as presented \citep{laza2016characterization}, as: data to support the presence of MTX was not presented; no standard for gambieric acid A was used; and the peak at 6.29 min assigned to 54-deoxy CTX1B (panel b Fig. 9) was not highly similar to the 54-deoxy CTX1B standard peak (Fig. 9c). 
As 54-deoxy CTX1B is considered to be a fish metabolite \citep{yogi2011detailed}, it appears novel that it would have been found in a species of \textit{Gambierdiscus}. 
As the detection of CTX analogs using LC-MS is very difficult, and has not been conducted often for species of \textit{Gambierdiscus}, further work clarifying the toxin profile of more species will shed light on these issues.\\

The identification of \textit{Gambierdiscus} species producing CTXs in Australia has been hampered by several uncertainties and difficulties, and no identified strains that consistently produce known CTX analogs have yet been confirmed.
\emph{G. belizeanus} was has been reported from Heron Island, GBR, \citep{murray2014molecular}. 
Previously, CTX and MTX production in \emph{G. belizeanus} has been indicated via bioassay \citep{chinain2010growth,holland2013differences} although LC-MS analysis using known CTX analogs has not been conducted for this species as yet. 

A previous study found a possible CTX analog in a \textit{Gambierdiscus} strain from Queensland, however, the production of the compound was unstable, and the strain precedes the discovery of species diversity in Gambierdiscus \citep{holmes1991strain}, and the identification of the strain is therefore uncertain. 
Unfortunately, those cultures are no longer available, and therefore the identity of the species cannot now be verified \citep{holmes1991strain}. Based on the LC-MS/MS toxin profile of \textit{G. lapillus}, it produces a number of unknown compounds, which may include undescribed congeners of CTX. 
These would require further work in order to characterize them. 
The toxicity measurements of G. lapillus by mouse bioassay were found to be equally unusual. 
The pathology of the mice was atypical, and not indicative of previously reported MTX or CTX intoxication (R. Munday, pers. comm.). 
Whether the abnormal pathology is due to a possible unknown CTX congener, or to another toxin produced by this species, remains unknown. 
Further fractionation of whole cell extracts into aqueous methanol and dichloromethane partitions, which are expected to contain MTX from CTX respectively \citep{satake1993structure}, could be conducted to elucidate which class of toxin is likely causing the pathology. 
Whole cell extract MBAs in the literature were normalized to cells per MU by Litaker et al. (2010) (table 5 therein). 
Comparatively, HG4 and HG7 were much less toxic than all the reported samples. 
HG6 displayed a higher toxicity than the cultures established from bloom samples \citep{chinain1999seasonal}. 
The strain’s toxicity compared to the other reported strains from both the Atlantic and the Pacific was in the bottom quarter percentile. 
These studies precede the elucidation of the current \textit{Gambierdiscus} species complex, so it remains unclear which species these results relate to. 
Markedly, the toxicity was found to differ greatly between the \textit{G. lapillus} isolates, with the toxicity of HG6 being 150-fold higher than HG7, which was in turn more than 5-fold more toxic than HG4. 
The published intraspecies toxicity variation in \textit{G. polynesiensis} M.Chinain \& M.Faust via MBA was only 2-fold \citep{chinain2010growth}. Potential reasons for differing toxin production in cultures may be physiological, such as phosphorous limitation in the media and different stages of the growth phase and growth rate \cite{sperr1996variation,chinain2010growth}. 
However, the HG4, HG6, and HG7 were grown under the same conditions and harvested simultaneously, which indicates an intrastrain variation in toxin production, rather than external influence on toxin production regulation.
