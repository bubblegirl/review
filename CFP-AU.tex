\section*{Introduction}
\textit{Gambierdiscus} Adachi et Fukuyo is a genus of benthic microalgae, which colonize a variety of substrates in shallow tropical and sub-tropical waters, such as macroalgae and dead corrals (summarized in \cite{hoppenrath2014marine}).
The type species \emph{G. toxicus} Adachi \& Fukuyo was discovered in 1977 and the genus was considered monophyletic till the discovery of \emph{G. belizeanus} Faust 1995. The current species concept encompasses 11 species and 6 unnamed clades, as based on both distinct morphological and genetic data.
Some species of \emph{Gambierdiscus} produce ciguatoxins (CTX), the causative agent of ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) \cite{berdalet2012global}. CTX is introduced into the food chain when consumed by a vector species, usually because the toxic \emph{Gambierdiscus} is epiphytic to the macroalgal food source (Fig. ~\ref{fig:bioacc}). The CTXs are then passed up the food chain through bioaccumulation, a process which causes increased potency of the CTX congener through oxidation.
The populations of \emph{Gambierdiscus} vary between oceans, with some

A herbivore, e.g. white trevally (\emph{Pseudocaranx dentex}) \cite{trevally} consumes CTX from \emph{G. polynesiensis} along with the macroalgae, which is then either passes directly to humans through consumption, or through an intermediary piscivorous vector such as Australian spotted mackerel (\emph{Scomberomorus munroi}) \cite{mackerel}.
