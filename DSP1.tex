\section{General Introduction}
Biodiversity of phytoplankton was recently been uncovered at varying taxonomic levels with the advent of readily accessible population and species genetics \cite{simon2009diversity}. Ongoing development of molecular techniques herald rapid future advancement in species discovery and phylogeny elucidation \cite{murray2012genetic,murray2012transcriptomics}.
Interest in benthic dinoflagellates was sparked in 1977, when a new species, later named \emph{Gambierdiscus toxicus} was first suggested to produce the main toxin causing ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) \cite{yasumoto1977finding}.  
Since then, extensive research has established that species of the genus are the primary sources of ciguatoxins (CTXs) and maitotoxins (MTXs) \cite{chinain1997intraspecific,holmes1998gambierdiscus}. CTXs bioaccumulate through the food web until consumption of seafood with orally accumulative effective levels cause CFP \cite{bagnis1979clinical,gillespie1987possible,sims1987theoretical}. %Whether MTXs play a role in CFP needs to be further investigated \cite{kohli2014feeding}. 
For over 15 years \emph{Gambierdiscus} was considered to be a monotypic taxon, but since 1995 new species are being discovered with the aid of genetic analysis tools to illuminate the genus phylogeny \cite{faust1995observation,holmes1998gambierdiscus,litaker2009taxonomy,chinain1999morphology,fraga2011gambierdiscus,nishimura2014morphology}. Evidence suggests that the production of CTXs and MTXs varies between species \cite{chinain2010growth,holland2013differences}. This is similar to the situation in other dinoflagellates, in which toxin production is highly variable between species, and generally more stable within species.

CFP is the most common non bacterial illness associated with seafood consumption, posing a global problem \cite{friedman2008ciguatera}. %CFP problem ref! + seafood trade
Annual reported CFP cases are estimated up to 500,000 a year globally and are responsible for 80 to 96 \% of human poisoning from consuming seafood \cite{fleming1998seafood,grandjean2008centers}, however correct diagnosis is problematic. It relies on the medical professional connecting the symptoms with recent fish consumption while eliminating other possible marine poisons. In Queensland, Australia, it is estimated that less than 20 \% of cases are reported \cite{lewis2006ciguatera}.
The symptoms of CFP can vary widely \cite{sims1987theoretical}. CFP manifests as gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and neurological symptoms which can last weeks to months, years in severe cases, and be re-triggered by consumption of alcohol or certain foods \cite{lewis2006ciguatera}. Adams produces a detailed report of eight people contracting CFP from the same meal, hence assumed the same toxin profile, but eliciting varied symptoms and length of the condition \cite{adams1993outbreak}. 
A study correlating CFP related calls from the US National Poison Centre Data with storms and sea surface temperature showed that sea surface temperature was a relevant factor for CFP incidence and extrapolated that climate change related sea temperature rise could escalate CFP by 200 - 400 \% in the US \cite{garces2012habitat}. A study of preferential substrate colonisation showed that species of \emph{Gambierdiscus} favoured dead corals, which will increase in availability with coral bleaching \cite{grzebyk1994ecology}. Over the last decade, CFP incidence has increased by 60\% in Pacific Islands \cite{skinner2011ciguatera}.
CFP has been reported in the Caribbean, Pacific and Indian oceans, however there is evidence that \emph{Gambierdiscus} is expanding it's habitat. In the Mediterranean Sea \cite{lejeusne2010climate}, \emph{Gambierdiscus} has been detected only since the early 2000s \cite{aligizaki2008morphological}.
Understanding the phylogeny and species specific toxicology of \emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. is essential as part as global HAB species monitoring for early warning system for CFP outbreaks \cite{berdalet2012global}.

\section{The genus \emph{Gambierdiscus}}
%incl aspects of local and geo distr.
\subsection{Morphology}

When \emph{Gambierdiscus} was first described by Adachi and Fukuyo in 1979 it was believed to be a monotypic taxon with \emph{G. toxicus} as it's sole representative \cite{adachi1979thecal}. Inconsistency in morphology and toxicity were observed which led to another species discovery 15 years later \cite{faust1995observation,holmes1990toxicity,holmes1991strain,chinain1997intraspecific,richlen2008phylogeography,bomber1988epiphytic,bomber1989epiphytism,bomber1989genitic,morton1993response}. Currently 13 species and 6 ribotypes have been described (Table ~\ref{tbl:MorphTable}) based on their distinct morphological and genetic characteristics. New discovery of species with increased global sampling is likely. \\

The descriptions in Table ~\ref{tbl:MorphTable} contain an overview of the main morphological characteristics for currently described \emph{Gambierdiscus} sp. The terminology used has been conformed to the proposed terms from Hoppenrath et al \cite{hoppenrath2013taxonomy}. The initial species description detailed \emph{Gambierdiscus} to be large (60-100 $\mu$m), armoured with a distinct plate pattern and fishhook shaped accessory pore. Species fall into two categories - antero-posteriorly compressed, also described as lenticular, or slightly laterally compressed, or globular. Further classification is based on characteristics such as plate patterns and accessory pore shape. %ref

These features can be readily identified using scanning electron microscopy. However the strain specific variability of morphology within species, such as in size and shape of individual plates, makes this a support tool for classification which should be verified with genetic analysis. \\

Phylogenetic analysis is a powerful tool that will be essential in elucidating the evolutionary relationships of species and genera. Molecular genetic tools for discriminating species of Gambierdiscus from one another have been frequently applied, particularly in the last 10 years. These have consisted of ‘barcoding’ regions of genes such as large subunit (LSU) rRNA, small subunit (SSU) rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rRNA. From such analysis, the current consensus is that \emph{Gambierdiscus} is monophyletic, with the lenticular and globular species forming two distinct clades \cite{chinain1999morphology,litaker2009taxonomy,fraga2011gambierdiscus,richlen2008phylogeography,kuno2010genetic,litaker2010global,nishimura2013genetic}. \\
Phylogenetic analysis concluded that the globular clade containing \emph{G. ruetzleri} and \emph{G. yasumotoi} diverged early in the evolution of the genus \cite{litaker2009taxonomy,nishimura2013genetic}. The two species are also the most closely related within the genus, and cannot be clearly distinguished from one another based on either molecular sequences of strains from different localities, or based on morphological features. 

Based on D8-D10 LSU rRNA sequences, \emph{Gambierdiscus} ribotype 2 was designated putative new phylotypes by Litaker et al \cite{litaker2010global} as well as \emph{Gambierdiscus} species type 4, 5 and 6 by Xu et al \cite{xu2014distribution}. \emph{Gambierdiscus} species types 2 and 3 are also supported as consisting of genetically distinct clades based on an analysis of SSU rRNA sequences \cite{nishimura2013genetic,kuno2010genetic}. The species\emph{G. scabrosus}, previously \emph{Gambierdiscus} species type 1 \cite{nishimura2013genetic,nishimura2014morphology},  and \emph{G. silvae}, previously Gambierdiscus ribotype 1 \cite{fraga2014genus}, have been identified based initially only on their divergent genetic sequences. Following this, morphological features that confirmed their identities were also described. 

An emerging issue in the identification of species of Gambierdiscus is the larger than previously anticipated differences in morphological features within a species. For example, within Gambierdiscus yasumotoi and G. carpenteri, morphological features that were considered to be consistent within the species and were used to circumscribe the species have been found to vary considerably \cite{murray2014molecular,kohli2014high}.

\section{Toxins produced by \emph{Gambierdiscus}}
Seafood contaminated with ciguatoxins` is characteristically impossible to discern during preparation as it does not exhibit any differences to non toxic seafood and the toxins are heat resistant \cite{withers1982ciguatera}. Hence toxin presence is usually only diagnosed retrospectively from CFP symptoms in conjunction with recent seafood consumption \cite{sims1987theoretical}. Samples of the food consumed are rarely obtained. CFP is predicted to be widely under reported with as little of 20 \% of cases being reported  in Queensland, Australia \cite{lewis2006ciguatera}. The disease can manifest as over 180 symptoms, with varying levels of severity, and differ even between individuals at the same time and source of exposure \cite{sims1987theoretical}. The effects of CFP appear to be cumulative, as severity increases with previous exposure \cite{emerson1983preliminary}. Commonly several hours after consumption, the initial symptoms are gastrointestinal, which can be followed by cardiovascular and neurological manifestations \cite{sims1987theoretical}. They can persist between weeks to years. Recurrence is a common phenomenon induced by the factors: alcohol, fish or meat consumption \cite{lewis2006ciguatera} as well as sexual activity \cite{lange1992travel}. \\
Symptoms of CFP can vary between geographical locations \cite{molgo2000ciguatera,dickey2010ciguatera}, which likely contributes to the inefficiency of diagnoses. This could be due to the structural difference between CTX analogues ///REF//. Hence the accurate determination of CTX congeners is vital to understanding toxicology of CFP.\\

We do not yet have clear information available on the toxin profiles of each species of Gambierdiscus, particularly comparative assays of multiple species which have applied a consistent methodology. Bioassays provide an excellent indicator of a species' toxicity, however it does not suffice to elucidate a detailed toxin profile - liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) or tandem LC-MS/MS analysis is required \cite{diogened2014chemistry}. \emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. produce more than just CTXs - notably MTXs are also commonly registered \cite{holmes1994purification,murata1993structure}. It has, until recently, been assumed in the literature that CTXs are the sole toxins causing CFP, CTXs have been isolated from the Pacific, Caribbean and the Indian Oceans. The  structure varies between the Pacific and the Caribbean congeners, with the structures of some of the Indian Ocean analogues still to be determined. \\

\subsection{CTX}
CTX and its analogues are lipid soluble polyether ladder compounds which act as sodium channel activators \cite{dechraoui1999ciguatoxins}. They are orally effective in humans at the picomolar (pM) and millimolar (mM) concentration range \cite{molgo2000ciguatera}, causing an influx of Na$^{+}$ ions and hence spontaneous action potentials in the cell, especially active on voltage sensitive channels along the nodes of Ranvier \cite{sims1987theoretical,mattei1999neurotoxins,lewis1992action,molgo2000ciguatera}. \\
Currently CTXs are prefixed by their origin, where members from the Pacific, Caribbean and Indian Oceans are designated P-CTX, C-CTX and I-CTX respectively. % don't know C-PTX subdivision ref... for P-CTX it's \cite{} I-CYX is\cite}

The congeners are further subdivided on a structural basis into type I and type II within P-CTXs, followed by all C-CTXs as type III - the molecular structure of I-CTXs have not been elucidated to such an extent as to assign a type \cite{legrand1997two,hamilton2002multiple,hamilton2002isolation} (Table ~\ref{tbl:CTXTable}).  \\

Type I P-CTXs consist of 13 rings with 60 C atoms \cite{murata1990structures,lewis1991purification,lewis1993origin}. The first completely defined CTX was isolated from moray eels, and was designated P-CTX-1B \cite{murata1990structures} or also described as CTX-1 \cite{lewis1991purification}. P-CTX-2 and P-CTX-3 were isolated from the same extracts but exhibited an alternate structure and toxicity in mice \cite{lewis1991purification}. It has been suggested by two research groups that P-CTX-1, P-CTX-2 and P-CTX-3 may be derivatives from the dinoflagellate precursors CTX-4A and CTX-4B (also GTX-4B by Murata et al \cite{murata1990structures}) \cite{lewis1993origin,yasumoto2000structural}. So far, P-CTX-4A and P-CTX-4B have been isolated from \emph{G. polynesiensis} culture extracts \cite{chinain2010growth}, while P-CTX-1, P-CTX-2 and P-CTX-3 have not. \\

The structure for type II P-CTX-3C consists of 13 ring and 57 C atoms and has been isolated first from \emph{G. toxicus} in 1993 \cite{satake1993structure}, when \emph{Gambierdiscus} was still designated as monophyletic, then in 2010 from \emph{G. polynesiensis} \cite{chinain2010growth}. There are two known congeners of P-CTX-3C which have been isolated - 49-epi-CTX-3C (or CTX-3B by Chinain et al \cite{chinain2010growth}) and M-seco-CTX-3C from \emph{Gambierdiscus} \cite{satake1993structure} and \emph{G. polynesiensis} \cite{chinain2010growth}. Two type II CTXs have been isolated from Moray eel, 2,3-dihydroxy-CTX-3C (or CTX-2A1) and 51-hydroxy-CTX-3C \cite{satake1998isolation}, and are suspected to constitute oxygenated metabolites of P-CTX-3. \\ %\cite{yasumoto2000structural} check ref as well as if P-CTX3 or P-CTX-3C 

Structurally C-CTXs were resolved to consist of 14 rings and 62 C atoms, with multiple congeners isolated from carnivorous fish - C-CTX-1, C-CTX-2, C-CTX-1127, C-CTX-1141, C-CTX-1143, C-CTX-1157, C-CTX-1159 \cite{vernoux1997isolation,lewis1998structure,pottier2003identification,pottier2002characterisation}. As yet, no C-CTXs have been isolated from any of the endemic \emph{Gambierdiscus} spp., Fraga et al have shown that \emph{G. excentricus} from the Canary Islands produce CTX and MTX like compounds as detected by N2A. The characterisation of these toxins using LC-MS is in process \cite{fraga2011gambierdiscus}. \\

The most recently discovered group of CTXs is from the Indian Ocean, where I-CTX-1, I-CTX-2, I-CTX-3 and I-CTX-4 were isolated from carnivorous fish. Their structure has not yet been established, preventing classification to a sub type \cite{hamilton2002multiple,hamilton2002isolation}. It has been elucidated that they have a higher molecular weight in comparison to P-CTXs and C-CTXs \cite{caillaud2010update,hamilton2002multiple,hamilton2002isolation}. \\ %I-CTX-1 toxic to mice via intraperitoneal injection \cite{hamilton2002isolation}. 

It has been suggested that the evident variety of CTX congeners, found even in the same ecosystem, is due to modification to the toxin structure as it passes up the food chain. This process can increase potency up to 10-fold \cite{hokama1996human,lewis2006ciguatera}. This theory is supported by a study conducted by Mak et al, examining the CTX composition of different members of a ciguateric food web \cite{mak2013pacific}.

%Indigenous population's understanding of ciguateric fish may help prevent CFP. 
%Experiemntation of P-CTX-1 injeted into rats intravenously showed rapid distribution to tissue and high bioavailibility of toxin via Neuro2a assay 
%cite{ledreux2013bioavailability}.

\subsection{MTX}

MTXs are the largest known proteinacious natural product \cite{yokoyama1988some,murata1993structure} and is a highly toxic Ca$^{2+}$ channel activator, with a LD$_{50}$ 0.05 $\mu$g/kg. There are only a couple of known bacterial, proteinacious toxins with higher potency \cite{yokoyama1988some,murata1993structure}. However the Ca$^{2+}$ activation is a secondary process of MTX activity, the primary mode of action in mammalian cells  is still unclear \cite{van2000diversity}. MTX is a water soluble, polyether ladder compound. It was first isolated in 1976 from the gut of a form herbivorous fish species with the common name 'Maito' \cite{yasumoto1976toxicity}. Their complex structure and stereochemistry was elucidated in the 1990s using stereoscopic studies and partial synthesis \cite{murata1993structure,murata1994structure,satake1995structural,nonomura1996complete,zheng1996complete}. \\

There are three known analogues of MTX (table ~\ref{tbl:MTXTable}) - designated MTX-1, MTX-2 and MTX-3, isolated from a \emph{Gambierdiscus} sp. in Queensland, Australia \cite{holmes1994purification}. MTX-1 and MTX-2 are structurally larger than the third. \\ %who isolated it first? yokoyama? 

%Biophysical characteristics of pacific MTXs different to caribbean MTX \cite{lu2013caribbean}. Carribean MTX not been charactrised, so whether the difference in action is structural is speculative. %check lit

%MTX easier to detect and quantify than CTX due to sulphate esters using liquid chromatography-electronspray ionisation-mass spectrometry (T. Harwood pers. com.). Solvolysis (desulphonation) reduces toxicity 100-fold or more \cite{murata1991effect}.

\subsection{Other}
Further toxins reportedly synthesised by \emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. are are gambieric acid, gambierol and gambieroxide \cite{watanabe2013gambieroxide,satake1993gambierol,nagai1992gambieric}.
Gambierol is less toxic than CTX with 80 $\mu$g/kg i.p. and 150 $\mu$g/kg orally in MBA, but fast acting with lethality setting in within 3 hrs\cite{ito2003pathological}. Gambierol could play a potential role in CFP, which to date has not been investigated. Though less toxic than CTX, it is still a highly toxic substance which could bioaccumulate in the food chain \cite{rhodes2014production}.\\
Gambieric acids A, B, C and D showed potent antifungal properties but no toxicity via MBA at 1000 $\mu$g/kg i.p. and hence are not of concern as a health hazard, including CFP \cite{rhodes2014production,nagai1992gambieric}.
Recently gambieroxide was isolated from \emph{G. toxicus} by Watanabe et al \cite{watanabe2013gambieroxide}. Gambieroxide's stereostructure has been elucidated by NMR and LC-MS/MS, concluding that it is structurally similar to yessotoxin (YTX) which is a lipophillic toxin found in filter feeding shellfish  \cite{tubaro2010yessotoxins}. Known producers of YTX are \emph{Protoceratium reticulatum}, \emph{Lingulodinium polyedrum} and \emph{Gonyaulax spinifera} \cite{tubaro2010yessotoxins} which are not  phylogenetically closely related to \emph{Gambierdiscus}.  Gambieroxide needs to be further investigated for structure, toxicity and bioaccumulative potential for assessment as a health threat, including CFP. \\

\section{Toxicity of different \emph{Gambierdiscus} spp.}
\emph{Gambierdiscus} spp. produce CTXs and MTXs \cite{murata1990structures,holmes1991strain,satake1993structure,holmes1994purification,satake1996isolation}, however, some wild and culturable strains have been recorded to not produce either or both toxins in measurable quantities \cite{gillespie1985significance,holmes1990toxicity}. Hence toxin production varies between species. Most studies were conducted in the 16 year time period pre-dating the discovery of \emph{G. belizeanus} in 1995 \cite{faust1995observation}, and therefore the strain used was refered to as \emph{Gambierdiscus toxicus}, although it may have been any of the now known species. Table ~\ref{tbl:GeoTable} shows known toxicity of each \emph{Gambierdiscus} species as detected via various essays and whether they have been characterised by LC-MS. \\

The Caribbean species \emph{G. excentricus} was tested with a neuroblastoma cytotoxicity assay (N2A) which indicated both MTX and CTX toxicity \cite{fraga2011gambierdiscus}. However the toxin profile needs to be extrapolated with LC-MS.
Chinain et al identified the toxins produced by two strains of \emph{G. polynesiensis} with LC-MS. The major toxin produced was P-CTX-3C, other type II (M-seco-CTX-3C, 49-epi-CTX-3C) and type I (CTX-4A, CTX-4B) toxins were detected. The different strains produced the same toxins, but at different proportions \cite{chinain2010growth}. In an earlier study, Chinain et al detected toxicity of the water soluble fraction of \emph{G. polynesiensis} in a mouse bioassay (MBA), implicating MTX activity \cite{chinain1999morphology}. Rhodes et al produced evidence to the contrary, as they found no LC-MS measurable MTX in a strain of \emph{G. polynesiensis} from the Cook Islands \cite{rhodes2014production}.
\emph{G. australes} extracts isolated by Rhodes et al indicated CTX and MTX presence by displaying toxic activity in both lipid and water soluble fractions when tested with MBA. However, LC-MS/MS analysis did not detect any CTXs. A follow up study on the same strain with LC-MS also found no CTXs, but potent MTX-3 like compounds were detected \cite{rhodes2014production,rhodes2010toxic}. In contrast, three different \emph{G. australes} strains isolated from French Polynesia, tested with a receptor binding assay (RBA), produced P-CTX-3C like compounds \cite{chinain2010growth}.\\

Holland et al conducted a large scale two year toxicity screening of 56 strains from 6 species of \emph{G. belizeanus, G. caribaeus, G. carolinianus, G. carpenteri, G. rutzleri} and  \emph{Gambierdiscus} ribotype 2, using human erythrocyte lysis assay (HELA) \cite{holland2013differences}. Haemolytic activity is a well established property of MTX \cite{igarashi1999mechanisms}, which is the implication from Holland's study. It showed that the haemolytic activity varied marginally between strains but stayed consistent for each strain over the two year sampling period, indicating that MTX production, and congener suite, varies between the species but remains consistent over time within a strain \cite{holland2013differences}.
In contrast, a recent study of CTX-like toxicity using mouse neuroblastoma assay (MNA) of the new \emph{Gambierdiscus} ribotypes 4, 5 and 6 found that the isolates from a ciguateric site were up to 4\- fold more toxic compared to isolates from a geographically closely related non-ciguateric reference site \cite{xu2014distribution}. This observed difference in MTX and CTX production staying constant and varying respectively, could be due to CTX production increasing in a ciguateric setting, or something other than temperature variation changes MTX production. The findings of both of these studies need to be verified with LC-MS. \\

These case studies show that while bioassays are important to indicate toxicity, LC-MS studies of every species need to be conducted to define their toxin profiles.
